Feeling Human is an insightful, challenging, and terrifyingly-real exploration into the depths of the human experience. What is happiness? What is pain? What does it really mean to feel human? Driven by a creative spirit and boundless curiosity, artist Elgin Davis draws us into a deeper understanding of our own humanity through awkwardly-intimate conversations with strangers from around the world, in addition to his own unfiltered musings about the world we live in. Feeling Human brings the raw power of emotion to hard topics, ranging from mental health to emotional intelligence, and from fear of failure to what it really looks like to live a hyper-meaningful existence here on earth. The people we meet, the love we share, and the stories we tell to capture it all shape the very nature of our humanityâ€” can you feel it?
