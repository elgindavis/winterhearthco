Rest &#x26; Recovery is something that is often overlooked, though it is often just what we need to take our work and life to the next level. Speaking of rest, this week Winter Hearth Studios is taking a trip to Europe to explore the hearts of Spain and France (otherwise known as spring break ). The content in the below sections will show you how important rest can be to our mental and emotional states, so be sure to check them out! We won't be back with another edition for 2 weeks, so you'll have plenty of time to catch up on any editions you may have missed in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://hurryslowly.co/012-alex-pang/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/304ff7f0-0153-4918-806a-cc4802cc4607.png' alt='Hurry Slowly logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week, we'll take a quick look at the Hurry Slowly episode \"<a href=\"https://hurryslowly.co/012-alex-pang/\">Prioritizing Rest &#x26; Reflection</a>\" with <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/alex-pang-phd\">Alex Pang Ph.D</a>. Dr. Pang is the author of the book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465074871/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=jkglei-20&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0465074871&#x26;linkId=4f5183c866081e15343d87bd9d3c525b\">Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</a>\", and emphasizes the importance of a balance between deep, focused work and deliberate rest. There's a lot of great insights in this episode, so I'll let Alex and Jocelyn do the talking.</p>\n<p>Check out the episode to gain some new insights on using rest as a tool for achievement!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://hurryslowly.co/012-alex-pang/'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast-episode/198-design-your-happiness-project/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/a8cc307e-f414-4e03-81e7-3b8f2b923e3d.jpg' alt='Gretchen Rubin Happier podcast artwork'/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, I want to dive into another episode from the podcast Happier with Gretchen Rubin. In the episode <a href=\"https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast-episode/198-design-your-happiness-project/\">Design Your Own \"Happiness Project\"</a>, Rubin presents a novel and exciting idea of creating some sort of project that \"helps you identify the resolutions that will bring more happiness to your life -- and then helps you keep those resolutions\". In last week's playbook edition, we talked briefly about filling the blank spaces in your life with the things you love to do and the people you love to do those things with. This idea is a part of the active rest we need to remain emotionally and mentally stable, physically healthy, spiritually attuned, and in a generally more positive and uplifting state of mind.

Have you ever been around someone who is cranky or grumpy (or both) when they don't get enough sleep? Odds are if you've ever seen crying babies, you've seen someone like this. It's not their fault necessarily, but one thing that we should understand is the limits posed on our mental and emotional functionalities when our brain hasn't had enough time to recover from the last stretch of activity. Personally speaking, I can usually feel how little control I have over my emotions and reactions when I am operating in a sleep-deprived, mentally exhausted state. Beyond learning to better control your emotions in this exhausted state, one of the best things you can do here is learn to avoid being in that state altogether.</p>\n<p>We live in an always-on, always-active society, and it can seem counterintuitive and even counterproductive to schedule some downtime for yourself, but active rest is one of the most important things we can do to keep our spaces (mental, emotional, spiritual, physical) healthy. Check out <a href=\"https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/why-its-important-schedule-more-downtime-your-brain\">this article from shape.com</a> to learn more of the science behind this idea and to learn some concrete steps for keeping your mental health in top form.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/why-its-important-schedule-more-downtime-your-brain'>Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6b28c040-3dcc-40c1-a92c-375b4fa4bd2c.png' alt='MopBoy in action in game demo'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        MopBoy in action\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a simple, calm piece from Winter Hearth Studios called \"Quietude\". This week, in the spirit of rest, we're going to relax a bit and check out the brand new desktop game experience from Winter Hearth community members <a href=\"https://cakezero.itch.io/\">CakeZero</a> called \"MopBoy\". </p>\n<p>According to CakeZero, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Mop Boy is a top down rpg/ side-scrolling platformer hybrid about a family owned restaurant and the boy who mops its floors. The game centers around Mop Boy, a kid whose family owns and lives above a pizza restaurant, Doughboys (based on our team member’s family-owned restaurant of the same name). While the other members of the Boy family have normal restaurant jobs (running deliveries, cooking, taking orders), he’s left battling the grease lingering from the daily grind. Upstairs, Mop unwinds and replenishes lost health while bonding with his family.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is sure to be a charming and exciting game, and I can't wait to play the Mac release when it comes out -- great work CakeZero! Thanks for sharing your creation with us.</p>\n<p>You can follow the team <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MopBoyGame\">@MopBoyGame</a> on Twitter and <a href=\"http://instagram.com/mopboygame\">@mopboygame</a> on Instagram to keep up with the development and support their work, and <a href=\"https://cakezero.itch.io/mop-boy-demo\">check out the MopBoy demo here</a>!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://cakezero.itch.io/mop-boy-demo'>Check out the demo!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!
