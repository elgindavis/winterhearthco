EQ, as we've encountered before in this weekly publication, stands for Emotional Quotient, and is a counterpart to IQ, or Intelligence Quotient. The EQ is a measure of the emotional intelligence of an individual, or, in simpler terms, the individual's ability to read, recognize, and respond appropriately to the emotions of the self and of others. It's a pretty complex concept, but for now, we'll simplify it with this definition. Check out the rest of the digest to learn how to build your EQ this week.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.npr.org/2014/12/19/371689720/why-aren-t-we-more-compassionate'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0185a1b2-3704-49f3-90cd-177f8224db19.jpg' alt='TED npr logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week, we're going to check out a talk from one of the pioneers of the EQ framework, Daniel Goleman.

In <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2018/05/29/5-ways-to-develop-your-emotional-intelligence/#2489cfb06976\">this article from Forbes</a>, we learn 5 concrete ways to develop our emotional intelligence. I'll outline each method below, and give an example of what this might look like for you in practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manage your negative emotions</strong>. This is one of the core tenets of emotional intelligence. The ability to recover from negative emotions will change your life drastically, because regardless of what happens to you, if you have trained this skill, adversity will lose its power over your emotional state. In practice, this often means putting life in greater perspective when negative events happen. For example, spilling a cup of coffee and being debilitated by the event for the rest of the day is not managing the emotional state correctly (please don't cry about spilled coffee... or milk... just don't do it). Instead, in developing your EQ, you might realize that in the grand scheme of life, a spilled cup of coffee is probably the least of your worries, and you collect yourself and carry on with the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Be mindful of your vocabulary</strong>. I published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790\">this article on Medium</a> a month ago, outlining 8 ways to practice empathy. This is similar to steps 5 and 6 from the article — choosing your words to accurately convey what you are thinking is crucial in developing your EQ. For you, this may mean more descriptive words, like 'frustrated', 'irritated', or 'disgusted', rather than the commonly misused word 'upset' that is used by many people today to represent most negative emotions.\nPractice empathy.  In the same Medium article referred to in the last point, I note that the most important way to practice empathy, perhaps, is to refrain from assuming things about people, especially things that seem to make sense to you but may not actually be true. The example I give in the article is the assumption that because someone hasn't responded to a text message for a few hours that they must be ignoring you or they must be upset when, in reality, you don't always know for sure what may actually be going on in someone else's life. Use your creativity instead to place yourself in the other's shoes.</li>\n<li><strong>Know your stressors</strong>. Knowing what pushes your buttons makes it easier to manage those negative emotions before they ever arise. For example, you know that you are going to be enraged if your child comes home late for the fourth time this week. When it's getting late and little Timmy isn't home yet, you may become aware of your rising stress level. You are then able to collect yourself and prepare for a more thoughtful (and less terrifying) interaction when Timmy does finally arrive past curfew.</li>\n<li><strong>Bounce back from adversity</strong>. There are plenty of trite expressions about \"bouncing back from adversity\", but there is a reason for this. The thing about adversity is, growth is necessarily uncomfortable. If we weren't pushed from our comfortable, centered emotional states, we would almost never have the opportunity to grow as people. We'd probably just stagnate, never improving or developing these skills. For example, failing a test in school or a project at work does not necessitate dropping out of school or quitting your job. No, in fact, the adversity has just shown you what you need to improve on, and when you make the choice to accept that challenge, you build up that mental muscle of resilience that will probably come in handy one day in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'> Check out the full article!</a>\n</div>\n \n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/la-sagrada-familia-23cd1ec70b67\">La Sagrada Familia</a>\" from Winter Hearth Studios.

I get that. I actually don’t subscribe to any news or updates myself, so most of the updates I get are from one of my family members. Pandemic aside, one thing that really alarms me in this situation is what this frantic search for positivity reveals about the mental and emotional capacities of most people, myself included— we can’t handle the darkness.</p>\n<h3>The Problem With Seeking the \"Bright Side\"</h3>\n<p>People operate erratically out of fear, worry, and anxiety because they don’t know how to process those darker, less pleasant emotions (looking at you, TP hoarders). Either they haven’t had many opportunities to sharpen those skills, or they misjudge those opportunities and run from them instead of using them as growth tools. One thing I’ve learned is that our desperate search for the “bright side” isn’t the solution. In fact, as we run away from reality right now to find these safer, happier places for our minds to rest, we continue to promote this behavior in ourselves and others. We also completely miss the opportunity to grow amidst the chaos and mature ourselves emotionally. The worst part in my opinion is that the next time something terrible occurs, we will be just as emotionally ill-equipped to face the situation then as we are now.</p>\n<h3>Adversity and Opportunity</h3>\n<p>Adversity and opportunity really aren’t so different. It’s more a matter of how you choose to perceive and respond to them that makes all the difference. Let me be clear— good news isn't the problem. In fact it's, well, good. The issue lies in the way we are using good news as an escape. This is the best opportunity I’ve seen for the global community to learn how to process, manage, and harness our emotions to move to higher levels of emotional resilience and intelligence. I won’t get into the methods in this post in particular (check out this edition of the Epic Life Playbook for more on building emotional resilience and intelligence), but I just want to show you that you have an option here:</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>You can keep avoiding reality— there's no shame you if you’re at this point right now, it isn't easy— or you can plant yourself firmly, prepare to dig in deep, and start processing those big, hairy emotions. The decision is, and will always be, yours to make.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Apr 05, 2020","title":"Pandemics and the Quest for Good News","imageUrl":"/img/blog/good-news-600p.jpg","imageAltText":"Good News Newspaper","featured":true,"newsletterVolume":null,"contentType":"blog","tags":["Emotions","Pandemics","Good News","Lifestyle"],"keywords":"Emotions, Pandemics, Good News, Lifestyle","description":"In this world there will be troubles...

The “pursuit of happiness” has always stood out to me as being an\ninteresting addition to this list, positing happiness as some sort of right to be protected, or even a goal worth\ndevoting one’s life toward pursuing.</p>\n<p> Skipping ahead to the present, when I hear people talk about their life's goals, they often talk\nabout how much they just want to “be happy”. I’ll admit, for me it’s much better to hear this as a goal than to hear\nabout how someone just wants to be rich and/or famous, but there’s still an issue here: <strong>“being happy” is not a real goal.</strong>\nI’m not sure how much the founding fathers knew about emotions back in the day, but had they made the same advancements\nin psychology and biology in the 1700s as we’ve made to-date in 2020, perhaps they also would have realized that\nhappiness isn’t a real goal. And perhaps, by the end of this article, you’ll realize the same thing.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What are emotions?</h3>\n<p>Before we get to the heart of why I’m not actually an evil dream-crusher, we need to understand a few key things about\nemotions, most of which I’ve learned from the brilliant minds of Susan David, Susanne Denham, and Jeanne Segal. First\nthings first— what are emotions? Essentially, emotions are information. This foundational fact is usually where most\npeople depart in their understanding of happiness and their goals of “being happy”. Individuals whose life goal is to\n“be happy”, though well-intentioned and sincere as they may be, don’t truly understand how emotions work, and if they\ndon’t understand how the game works, how will they ever win? In short, you can’t be happy. In fact, you\ncan’t <em>be</em> any emotion, and the way that the average person understands emotions is actually based on this common\nmisunderstanding. <strong>Emotions are not things you can be — they are things that you feel.</strong> You can never be happy, sad, angry,\nafraid, or any other emotion. You can only feel those things, and those feelings give you information that you can use\nto guide your decisions.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Being vs. Feeling</h3>\n<p>Beyond the semantic lesson, this idea of <em>being vs. feeling</em> emotions shows us that emotions aren’t in control of our\nlives, though they can help us figure things out. Many of us live our lives as if the emotions are the goal (specifically\nthe positive ones). This is a confusing way to live for several reasons. For example, if your goal is to “be feel happy”,\nhow do you get there? How do you sustain that feeling? How do you avoid the other less desirable feelings? You should\nalso understand that emotions are temporary, just like any other experience. This means that anything you do to elicit a\ncertain emotion would have to be repeated to continually achieve the same effect.</p>\n<p>If I were to look at you in the eyeballs and say that my goal in life is to feel frustrated, what might you say? You might start by\ntelling me politely that it is a pretty ridiculous goal (it is), and you’d ask why I would want such a thing. My choice\nof goal would hopefully make it clear to you that I don’t understand how emotions work (and really how goal-setting\nworks, either). A deeper response would be to ask why I think feeling frustrated is even a goal at all. After all, do emotions make sense as goals?\nIs information your goal? In turn, if you told me that your goal in life was to be happy, I’d probably first note that you can’t be an emotion, and I’d\nfollow that up with the question, “Well, what makes you feel happy?” And that is where we find the real heart of this\nidea. As I mentioned earlier, emotions are not just feelings, they are also data. <strong><em>Emotions are the byproducts of meaningful\nevents that occur in our lives</em></strong>, and they give us information about how we perceive a situation and what we value most in\nthose moments.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Taking the Good with the Bad</h3>\n<p>For a long time people have gone on characterizing emotions as either <em>“good”</em> or <em>“bad”</em>, when really they are neither.\nEmotions are information. Important information. Undervalued and routinely misunderstood information. We live in a time\nwhere happiness is the life goal for so many people— people who don’t actually understand what happiness itself is. If\nyou want to consistently feel happy, the real goal should be to consistently do the\nthings that make you feel happy. However, I'd argue that it makes more sense to pursue the things you value and seek fulfillment there,\nrather than chasing after such a fleeting feeling, but that's just my opinion. </p>\n<br>\n<h3>Great... so what?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to emotions, we have to reverse-engineer the process in order to repeat it. If your goal is to reach a state of constant happiness,\n<strong>the real goal is creating and maintaining a system in your life that predictably produces those emotions in you.</strong>\nThat system would also have to protect against the enemies of your happiness, of which there are many. Even so, you\ncan make great strides in your life with this knowledge alone. That leads us now to the big question: </p>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If pursuing happiness means building a system that consistently produces the feeling of\nhappiness (while protecting you from other less desirable\nfeelings), is it even possible?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<p>An even better question, in my opinion, would be: </p>\n<br>\n<p><strong><em>Is pursuing a life based around an emotion worth your time?</em></strong></p>\n<br>\n<p>I’ll give you my own answers to these questions and more in an upcoming article.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Mar 30, 2020","title":"Why “Being Happy” Isn't a Real Goal","imageUrl":"/img/blog/happy-sign-600p.jpg","imageAltText":"Happy neon sign","featured":true,"newsletterVolume":null,"contentType":"blog","tags":["Emotional Intelligence","Happiness","Lifestyle"],"keywords":"happiness, emotions, emotional intelligence, goals, lifestyle","description":"'Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness'...

He grew up watching his dad go in to work early every day at the automobile…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-you-will-never-get-what-you-deserve/"},"html":"<p>Tommy is a hard worker, and he’s been that way his whole life. He grew up watching his dad go in to work early every day at the automobile factory. Often he would listen to his dad’s stories about the beauty of hard work and how hard work always pays off in the long-run. Tommy applied this work ethic throughout high school to his studies. He achieved an excellent GPA and got accepted into his dream school to study economics and business.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Tommy comes in to work early every morning to make sure everything is ready for an effective day of work. He has been working hard as a financial planner at the company for years, and has contributed lots of value to the culture and to the bottom-line. He has great attention to detail, and he’s also a very competent leader of his team. There’s a big promotion coming up for the head financial advisor position, and Tommy is ready to move up the ladder. If anyone in the company is deserving of this promotion, it’s Tommy. Here’s the catch— he actually doesn’t deserve this promotion, and he never will. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>The problem with \"deserving\"\nWhat comes to mind when you think of someone who deserves something? Is it a high school student with good grades and high SAT scores that deserves to get into a top university? Or maybe you think of someone who committed a crime and the kind of punishment they deserve. Perhaps a star athlete comes to mind— someone who has major talent and deserves to win a championship or medal. Maybe you even think of a hard-working person like Tommy deserving a promotion at the office. Those examples have a common issue: They share the perception that actions serve as a trigger to the universe that some outcome should happen. In a word, these examples are based on entitlement.</p>\n<p>Some people spend their whole lives believing that the world should work in a certain way or that it owes them something. This sets them up for variably unrealistic expectations of worldly outcomes. “I deserved that promotion.” “They deserved that award.” “He deserves to be in prison.” “She deserved to get fired.” ‘I deserved to get into that school.” This sense of entitlement is so common in the world, but it’s a distorted and confounding perspective. You are never entitled to a certain outcome. Nor am I. In fact, nobody is ever entitled to a certain outcome, and that is perhaps the most beautiful part of this truth.</p>\n<p>Coming into high school, I was denied admittance to a school of the arts after my audition as a trumpet player. I was also denied a spot in the All-District Honors County Jazz Band later that year. Should I have been outraged that I thought they didn’t recognize that I deserved a spot in their school or in that band? Should I have complained that they clearly didn’t recognize talent when they saw it? Should I reconsider my self-worth after failing to be admitted to these groups? Of course not. Yet, this is what so many of us do when reality doesn’t meet our expectations. This is often because we base our expectations on what we believe we deserved or which outcomes we believe we were entitled to. While it may sound ridiculous to ask those questions out loud, many of us still find ourselves asking them anyway.</p>\n<p>Here’s a question: Does the fact that you exist mean that the world owes you something in particular? As wonderful as I think you are, this world has no darlings, and it owes no debts to any man. We come into this world with nothing, and we will leave it just the same. Rest assured, the idea presented here is not that life is hopeless or that we’re not good enough to get what we want. You and your work are absolutely valuable, and hard work and diligence do often pay off. With that said, we must still understand how to frame our perspective, manage expectations, and learn how to manage our emotions.</p>\n<p>We see amazing football players go un-drafted in the NFL all the time. Why is that? Because they didn’t deserve to get drafted? Is it the case that only the people who deserved to get drafted were actually drafted? If someone isn’t selected during the draft, they simply weren’t selected during the draft. There’s no purpose in pondering who is more deserving than another to be drafted, because it will never change a single outcome. Most players are grateful to have even been afforded the opportunity to be a part of the draft, which is a much healthier and balanced mindset to adopt.</p>\n<p>A pride-free mindset\nWhen we adopt a humble mindset, things that go poorly don’t fall short of our expectations. This is because there was no initial belief of a guarantee for a certain outcome. Positive things that happen become cherished bonuses to be grateful for and appreciated. This mindset doesn’t mean that you put in any less effort in your endeavors or have any lest zeal for life. Instead you are learning to manage your frame of mind for outcomes beyond your control. You’ll still work hard in school to have a strong college application, but a denial won’t change your view of your self-worth. You’ll still practice countless hours to perfect your audition materials, but a poor outcome won't impact your confidence. You’ll still work really hard for that promotion, but being passed up only makes you work harder and smarter.</p>\n<p>At this point we raise the idea of merit, which I favor over the idea of entitlement by far. Merit implies a certain worthiness or fitness for an outcome to happen based on demonstrated achievement, ability, or the like. Tommy would certainly merit that promotion based on his work ethic and history, but that still doesn’t entitle him to have the position. That is to say that he also doesn’t “deserve” it (nor does anyone else). The difference between merit and entitlement is that merit is at least more objective in deeming why a certain result should occur. Even then, there is no universal law that says that the things that should happen will happen. This is why expecting should’s to always translate to will’s isn’t a reliable perspective framework. Tommy's hard work and attention to detail may increase the likelihood that the employers choose him for the position, but we can’t sensibly assign further meaning as to whether or not he (or anyone else) “deserves” the position more than the rest.</p>\n<p>But what about the things we all actually deserve?\nI expect many burning questions in response to this idea, such as: “What about deserving to be treated fairly?” “Are we not all entitled to be treated equally?” “What about deserving a right to live and be happy and safe?” “What about deserving to be loved?”</p>\n<p>These are all great things that we all understand, value, and appreciate, but what does it really mean to deserve them? These are tenets that must be present to form strong human relationships and a well-functioning, fair society for sure. However, to “deserve” these things means that we did something to earn them, and thus we should be entitled to have them. “Deserving” is really the wrong word here, and it’s also the wrong way to think about these matters. Let’s analyze one of these questions:\n“Why do I deserve to be treated fairly?” > Because all people should be treated fairly.\n“Why should all people be treated fairly?” > Because societies built on fairness are more trusting and amiable.\nIn this example, the situation is actually not about being deserving at all— it’s about the goal of building a trusting and amiable society. Even so, our belief that something (even something good) should happen still does not mean that it will. If we base our frame of reality on what we believe should happen, life will fail to meet our expectations more often than not. If we want something to change, we change it based on the underlying root goals and facts of the matter— not based on something flimsy like human entitlement.\nAs another example, I could say that I deserve to not have to deal with racial discrimination. It would be really great if nobody had to encounter this, but that belief by itself does not change any outcomes. Societies function much better when people don’t discriminate against each other, but that fact has little to do with my personal ‘deserving’ of anything. If you believe something needs to change, do something to change it. It is certainly helpful to have hope for these really nice things, and it's even better to have the passion and boldness to do something about it. Even so, I consider it to be pointless to expect the idea of entitlement to change even a single outcome— even if it is a great candidate for the should universe.</p>\n<p>Bottom Line\nThe bottom line is this: the concept of “deserving” is rooted in human pride and ego, rather than in gratitude and humility. This may very well be the most destructive part of this mindset. The concept of deserving is both subjective and biased, and more importantly— it isn’t measurable. There’s no way to truly measure how deserving someone is of some outcome, so what is the function that it serves in a healthy mindset? The beauty here lies in the understanding that once we check our egos and stop wasting energy on speculating the things we “rightfully deserve”, we can focus our energy instead on making our desired outcomes more likely to happen and on being grateful for everything positive that we actually receive.

We may easily overlook hidden lessons, such as in the charming and excited wag of Fido's tail or the loving twinkle in Brutus' eyes as you tell him all about your day. As it turns out, you’re probably overlooking some of the most powerful lessons dogs share with us about our world. While I'm sure that there are countless EQ lessons our lovable friends have in store for us, here are 4 game-changing keys to cultivating deeper, more emotionally-intelligent relationships.</p>\n<p>Listening.\nDogs are amazing listeners. Well, most dogs. Listening is one of the most powerful tools we have for building deeper social relationships— but don't we understand that one already? As it turns out, no, we don't. The nuance here is that many people hear, but they don't listen. A phrase I love to remind myself of is that \"we hear with our ears, but we listen with our hearts.\" The fact that the words someone is saying are registering in your brain doesn't mean that you're actually paying attention. Many dogs will sit and patiently listen to you talk, and give you their full attention, as the goodest good boys are known to do. However, just like humans, not all dogs are great listeners. Like when you tell Doug the Pug to stop scooting his butt across the carpet and he just smiles at you and keeps on scootin’— he hears you, he just isn't listening.</p>\n<p>We unknowingly (and sometimes knowingly) do this all the time to our friends. And if you don't think people can tell when you're not really listening, it’s probably more obvious to them than you think. A major key to developing these relationships is to really listen when people speak to you. This doesn't mean you silently wait for them to stop talking so you can finally have your long-awaited turn to speak. True listening is a skill, and it’s always intentional. You should actually care what the person is talking about, and if you don't, maybe you can change the subject to something that you both find engaging. One of the worst things you can do is to tune them out and keep on scootin’ across the floor.</p>\n<p>Curiosity.\nDogs are immensely curious, like when they want to know what will happen if they just so happen to poop in your house slippers. One of my favorite axioms from studying emotions and social interactions is that “curiosity drives empathy”. At the core of empathy is really just the inclination to ask meaningful questions about the other person— for example: \"How might she feel if I said this? What could I have said that made him so angry? Am I stepping in the middle of some unresolved issue?\" The list could go on forever, and that is exactly the point. If you're looking to foster more solid social relationships, ask more questions that go below the surface. Ask how your actions make the other person feel (literally, ask the question), and really listen to the answers and make any necessary adjustments. Channeling your curious spirit can break down barriers and increase mutual understanding.</p>\n<p>When meeting a new person I'll often ask them what their hopes and dreams are, bypassing the traditional, lackluster icebreaker questions that we’re all accustomed to and bored of. Be curious. Be a little playful. Show some genuine interest. The more curious you are and the more personalized questions you ask, the more time you’re spending intentionally thinking about that person, their wants, needs, desires, fears, and everything else. This can help you to find more in common, to open the gates to share interesting stories, and to actually demonstrate your interest in developing the relationship as a whole.</p>\n<p>Body language.\nYou've probably heard tons about body language, but few instances of it have ever been as charming as the proverbial wagging tail. Dogs show engagement, excitement, and amusement through wagging their tails. When you see the wagging tail, you know that the doggo is in a pretty positive state. Inversely, you know that when a dog has its tail tucked between its legs that it is probably afraid of something. Dogs are much less prone to hide their emotional states than humans, but we'll skip the talk about emotional vulnerability for now.</p>\n<p>Most \"tips and tricks\" (I wish this phrase was a slug and that I held the world's biggest salt shaker) only discuss “reading” body language, but not many focus on actually improving your own expressiveness and being intentional about letting others know, whether verbally or nonverbally, exactly how we feel. Dogs don't hide their excitement to see us when we come home after a long day of being apart, nor do they hide their disappointment when you take away the squirrel they caught in the backyard. Humans, on the other hand tend to play guessing games to make the other person have to \"figure out\" what they are feeling, thinking that they are teaching the other person a lesson (or something to that extent). Even if done for a decent reason, this strategy likely won’t give you the results you’re looking for. Most people are incapable of “figuring it out”, especially if they don’t have all of the relevant information (e.g. your feelings about certain behaviors) or a decent understanding of body language cues and emotional recognition. If you're looking to build stronger relationships, expressing your emotions is a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Play.\nIf there's one dogs are best at, it's melting our hearts. And just after that, they sure know how to play. It turns out that the joy and delight we see beaming across a pup’s face during social play is actually a moment of powerful social connection taking place. As humans, playfulness and humor allow us to navigate all sorts of sticky social situations, from heated conflict to public embarrassment. According to The Language of Emotional Intelligence by Jeanne Segal, Ph.D, mutually-shared positive experiences can “boost our mood, strengthen our resolve, and give us the incentive to sustain a positive connection with others”. She also notes that while any and all emotional sharing is able to build strong and lasting relationship bonds, sharing humor and “sheer delight” with another person adds a unique restorative and healing element to the mix, even reducing stress. Play allows us to let go of defensiveness, release our tightly-held inhibitions, and become more emotionally authentic with others and with ourselves.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite holiday memories is playing poolside card games with my cousins in Florida, which was always able to bring us closer together than watching any sporting event or movie ever did. Another example of play I’m fond of is a game I played with a friend at a live jazz concert. We would close our eyes and imagine the colorful stories the horns and guitars were painting with their music, and after the song ended, we traded our stories and enjoyed the fancy illustrations the other person was able to dream up. There is no hard-and-fast rule as to what actually counts as play— whether it be question games, word games, card games, imagined games, hide-and-seek, laser tag, catch, mutually-respectful joking, 4-square (or 2-square or 9-square or however many squares ya got), sports, “the floor is lava” (I’ll never forget the brave sacrifices made in this game), “the floor is java” (for any programming/coffee buffs out there), you name it (but not Monopoly— never Monopoly).</p>\n<p>Takeaways\nAs it seems, true listening, empathic curiosity, expressive body language, and intentional play are all crucial to developing sustainable, healthy, and enjoyable relationships— as our lovable, furry friends exemplify each and every day. Whether you choose to implement any of these keys in your actual life is, of course, up to you. Emotionally-intelligent relationships, though perhaps simple in theory, are not simple in reality. They take work, effort, patience, and time. Everything you try may not necessarily be successful right away, but your loved ones are worth the challenge. If you ever need inspiration, just remember that those good boys all over the world believe in your ability to make the world a happier, safer place for everyone, one wagging tail at a time.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Feb 07, 2020","title":"4 Lessons Dogs Teach Us About EQ","imageUrl":"/img/blog/dog-love-600p.jpg","imageAltText":"Wow, look at that happy pup","featured":true,"newsletterVolume":null,"contentType":"blog","tags":["Emotional Intelligence","Relationships","Lifestyle"],"keywords":"Emotional Intelligence, Relationships,Lifestyle","description":"Dogs melt our hearts every day, but it turns out there's a lot they can teach us, too.","unsplashBadgeInfo":{"artistName":"Joe Caione","artistUrl":"https://unsplash.com/@joeyc?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=photographer-credit&utm_content=creditBadge"},"author":{"name":"Elgin Davis","role":"Main Content Writer","summary":"Elgin Davis is the creator of Winter Hearth Studios.

I saved this one for the end because, unlike the rest of the topics we covered in Volume 2, Autism is not an illness. You'll learn more about that shortly.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy learning more about it in this final edition, and as I said in last week's edition, thank you so much for joining me on this journey to learn more about mental health. I've learned so much over the past few months, and I really hope that you have too. Feel free to directly reply to this email with any questions or comments you have about Volume 2, and I hope to see you in the future. I wish you the best in everything life has in store for you, and I hope that this newsletter project has had a positive impact on you and your life in some capacity. I've never done anything quite like this before, so hopefully it was useful for you :) </p>\n<p>Without further ado, let's get into our last edition of the series.</p>\n<br >\n<h3>What is Autism?</h3>\n<p>Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a broad neurobehavioral condition characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, and speech as well as nonverbal communication skills. In the U.S., ASD affects 1 in 59 kids, so just under 2% of kids, which is around 6 million kids in the U.S. for better perspective. ASD manifests itself differently in each child, which is why it is identified on a spectrum (the 'Spectrum' in Autism Spectrum Disorder).</p>\n<p>I've heard people make jokes about other people being 'on the spectrum' when they do something seemingly without thinking, which is actually incredibly disrespectful to people who have autism. There are actually several disrespectful things that people do and say pertaining to people with autism, potentially without even knowing it. Two that immediately come to mind are the limp hand repeatedly hitting the chest (usually accompanied by some sort of contorted/cross-eyed visage), and the use of the 'r' word. These things are used by comedians, musicians, artists, and regular people all over the world, and it is pretty disgusting to see how insensitive and ignorant people can be.</p>\n<p>Autism is usually identified in childhood, and this is where most of the strongest symptoms occur. Children with autism have trouble communicating, empathizing, and expressing themselves, and at times they also have trouble with seemingly ordinary sensations (smells, touch, sights, sounds). Symptoms typically appear in the first 3 years of life. Autism is not something that can be 'cured' per se, but it is rather a set of characteristics that accompanies an individual throughout life.</p>\n<p>The following is a list of social/behavioral symptoms from NIMH that someone with autism may exhibit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making little or inconsistent eye contact,</li>\n<li>Tending not to look at or listen to people,</li>\n<li>Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others,</li>\n<li>Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or to other verbal attempts to gain attention,</li>\n<li>Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversation,\nOften talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving others a chance to respond,</li>\n<li>Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said,\n-Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like,</li>\n<li>Having trouble understanding another person’s point of view or being unable to predict or understand other people’s actions.\n(NIMH, 2019)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the day, while ASD is indeed a diagnosable condition, it is just that — a condition — rather than an illness, as the other disorders we covered in this series were. People with autism are people just like you and me, just with differing sensibilities.\n<br/>  </p>\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/autism.jpg' alt='Autism creature, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 10px;\"> \n    Autism creature, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n  \n    \n<br />\n<h3>Autism Abstracted</h3>\n<br/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>'Just like its effects, the Autism monster comes in many forms with different impacts on those it touches. It carries an ever-changing lens that can distort and present a different view of the world than what others see. This can lead to trouble understanding social interactions, difficulties when communicating and leaves the affected person's senses in overload. However, this unique view can also impart positive qualities such as an intense focus and attention to detain, a remarkable memory or a heightened intelligence and imagination.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Autism monster is more friendly than most mental conditions and is a lifelong companion, sometimes becoming a valued part of everyday life to those who are affected by it.'</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this description, as well as the charming character beside it, is simply beautiful. You see, Autism is not an illness, nor is it something to be cured. Being different isn't a negative thing, and Autism especially has a hand in the shaping of some really cool, unique, and interesting people.<br>\n<br/></p>\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 10px;\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>People with Autism are often called 'weird' (or, more often, a worse name that begins with an 'r') by people who are not only disrespectful enough to label anyone as such, but also by people who lack the empathy to really try and understand someone's different behavior and sensibilities. I've known quite a few people with autism in my life, and I find it really upsetting when other kids (and even adults, really) target them, label them, bully them, and harass them for being different. We as a society are quick to label discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, etc. as exactly what it is: discrimination. However, when it comes to neurobehavioral differences, as people with autism have, people seem to think that the case is different. It is still discrimination, and there's no place for it.  </p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 10px;\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n  \n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>This is the last Mental Health Hack of the series, and instead of reaching for some grandiose, mind-blowing hack that nobody has ever heard of or tried before, I'll keep it simple: Give the love you wish to receive. I believe that one of human's highest callings in life is to love and to be loved, and if you want to be loved, you have to be willing to love others first.<br>\n<br >  </p>\n<h4>What does that look like in practice?</h4>\n<p>Ask deeper questions about others, showing them that you care about the personal details of their life. Remember names. I don't believe there's any validity to the all-too-common excuse 'I'm bad with names'. It's a half-baked excuse that people use to hide behind their lack of effort. Listen to people when they share, and don't indulge in the urge to project your life experiences onto theirs. There are some people that I talk to where I can sense that once they ask a question, they are just waiting for their next turn to talk, or they just jump in as I am talking, indicating to me that they believe that what they want to say is more important to them at that moment. Don't label people (negatively). Adjectives are great for describing nouns, but when they are used to describe people in particular, they carry more power than you may realize. Your words matter, even in secret. What you say is at some level what you think and believe. Remember that the tongue is a double-edged sword. Give without expecting anything in return. Things like this newsletter and my past mission trips are ways I like to give to others, sharing things I've learned and helping people better themselves. The only thing I really want is to know whether or not I've made a difference in someone's life.</p>\n<p>The list could go on forever, but I think you get the point. My brain is always stronger when I'm loving others than when I'm tearing them down, and I know that it will be the same case for you.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 10px;\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>You've gained so much knowledge about mental health at this point that you're basically an expert.

You might recall that for most all of the disorders that we've covered, daily hindrance or disruptions are usually crucial to the diagnosis of these disorders. Symptoms must last for at least 2 weeks to diagnose someone with depression, and these symptoms generally include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>\n<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>\n<li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>\n<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>\n<li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>\n<li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)</li>\n<li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>\n<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>\n<li>Thoughts of death or suicide  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>(American Psychiatric Association, 2019)</em></p>\n<p>There is also a lot of confusion when it comes to distinguishing depression from grief, because many of the symptoms are similar. One of the biggest differences is that with grief, self-esteem is usually not affected, while a depressed individual may experience increased feelings of worthlessness. Grief is also less consistent in terms of symptoms experienced. For example, if a grieving individual comes across positive memories of the person they are grieving, they may see their mood lift significantly, even if it soon sinks again. There is a major link here though, as the loss of a loved one can indeed lead to depression in an affected individual.</p>\n<p>Depression can also be further classified. Here is a list of the most common forms of depression:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Major Depression - the general form of depression, exhibiting the symptoms listed above,</li>\n<li>Persistent Depression/Dysthymia - depression lasting for two years or more,</li>\n<li>Bipolar Disorder/Manic Depressive Disorder - we covered this one a few weeks ago (check out that edition here),</li>\n<li>Depressive Psychosis - depression including hallucinations and delusions,</li>\n<li>Perinatal Depression - depression that occurs within pregnancy or within a month of childbirth. Postpartum depression is similar, but it can only occur after giving birth, while perinatal depression can occur during the pregnancy itself as well;</li>\n<li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder - depression linked to the menstrual cycle,</li>\n<li>Seasonal Depression/Seasonal Affective Disorder - depression related to certain seasons (often fall and winter when it is cold, dark, and the days seem shorter),</li>\n<li>Situational Depression - depression brought about by a certain event or series of events,</li>\n<li>Atypical Depression - symptoms temporarily go away in response to some positive events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/depression.jpg' alt='Depression, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Depression, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Depression Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The depression monster floats around endlessly, always covering his eyes to hide itself from the outside world. Because of this it always bumps into people or other monsters causing more distress to itself each time.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Its only relief is to wrap its fluid tail around a victim and share its depression with them. The victim is unaware of the monster but will register a heaviness and will develop a state of deep depression. Meanwhile the monster absorbs any positive emotion from its host until it has had its fill and moves onto another host.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The description and depiction here does a fairly good job of casting depression as some sort of parasite— something that latches onto a host and drains it of its vital, positive energy.</p>\n<p>As has been the case with all of these of these little monsters, they are separate from the human, and we get a unique opportunity to visualize something apart from the person having some negative effect on the person.</p>\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>Depression affects almost 7% of adults in any given year, and almost 17% of people will experience depression at some point in their lifetime (American Psychiatry Assoc.). In the U.S., that's about 21 million and 51 million people, respectively. Odds are that you've come across someone with some form of depression in your lifetime, whether you were able to identify it or not.</p>\n<p>When it comes to making our moves, trite cliches like \"Just be kind\" and \"We have to come together\" don't work for enacting change, because they are non-specific and really have no actionable value to them. If we're going to do something about helping people with depression, we need to be specific about what we actually should and should not be doing. Here are some suggested \"Should\"s and \"Should not\"s for us to consider:</p>\n<p><em>We Should:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow our friends and family to tell us how they are feeling without interrupting them,</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions of others that can lead to a better understanding of their experience with the symptoms listed earlier in this edition,</li>\n<li>Search for professional help on behalf of our loved ones, with their knowledge and consent,</li>\n<li>Make sure these people know that you are there for them and will actually listen to what they have to say.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>We should not:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell people to \"stop feeling\" any certain way. This is the most fruitless and counterproductive thing you can do (e.g. \"Stop being a sad sack,\" \"Can you stop crying all the time?\"),</li>\n<li>Tell others what you would do if you were them (you are not them),</li>\n<li>Ignore people that are experiencing depression because they \"dampen your mood\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are several other tips and tricks I could come up with, but ultimately the situation boils down to how much you care about others, and whether or not you will actually act on what you learn in a way that can help others. You can totally do this.</p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Do the things you were born to do. When you really think about it, there are certain things that only you can do in this life, given your unique set of experiences and talents, and if you don't do those things, nobody else will. It is so exciting and rewarding to be doing something solely because you feel like you were meant for it, and like it is precisely in your zone.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is more cognitively difficult to always be doing something that wears on you and doesn't give you life or joy. Find your zone and do your thing. Your brain will thank you for making its life easier.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>The challenge this week is to stop wasting time.

The event was absolutely tragic, and my heart goes out to the victims and those affected. During the speculation, it seemed to be perplexing that anyone would do such a thing, and it was very quickly suggested that there was a strong possibility that the woman suffered from mental illness. I have found that in these situations of murder, mass murder, suicide, etc. that people still throw out mental illness very early as an explanation when they can't fully understand the reasoning for some person to do something, and while it is quite possible that the woman suffered from a mental illness, associating the fact that someone did something \"unthinkable\" with mental illness is very much unfounded.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, if someone is going to suggest that mental illness is a probable cause for something taking place, they should be able to identify which specific mental illness they are talking about, because contextless generalities like \"she was probably mentally ill\" are the reason why the state of mental health awareness is as it is today and why I write this newsletter each week.</p>\n<p>As I noted a few editions ago, I struggle with my own mental illness, and for someone to say that mental illness in general makes people do horribly violent things very much affects me and the way that other people perceive people like me who have mental illnesses. None of the mental illnesses we've covered so far \"make people violent\". </p>\n<p>Bottom Line: The woman very well might have been suffering from a mental illness, but if someone is to say that the mental illness caused her to do something like this, they should have a concrete idea of which one they are referring to and the relevant symptoms. It is not right to conclude that mental illness causes people to do horrible things just because someone can't fathom other possibilities or motivations. People do many things for many reasons. Mental illness has been the scapegoat for explaining the motivations for violent crimes for far too long, and per the goals of this newsletter, we're working to fix that.  </p>\n<p>With that said, this week we're covering Post-traumatic Stress Disorder— another huge topic in the American community.</p>\n<br />\n<h3>What is Post-traumatic Stress Disorder?</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is born out of a traumatic experience. The disorder can actually stem from witnessing something traumatic happen to someone, as well as experiencing the traumatic event oneself. Every traumatic experience doesn't result in PTSD, but pretty much every instance of PTSD does stem from some form of trauma. The most common forms of traumatic events that lead to PTSD are combat exposure, childhood physical abuse, sexual violence, physical assault, being threatened with a weapon, and accidents. There are plenty of other examples, but you get the main idea from these examples.</p>\n<p>As we noted in an earlier edition of this playbook, PTSD is classified as an Anxiety Disorder, which you may recall is a specific psychiatric disorder that tends to involve crippling fear, worry, or apprehension, typically accompanied by compulsive behavior or panic attacks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into 4 types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and lastly changes in physical and emotional reactions. </p>\n<p>Intrusive memories may appear something like a war veteran reliving a particularly gruesome moment during a war, or even a person's recurring memories of a their dad physically abusing their mother decades ago. The intrusive memories don't always occur in the same scale of time, as each individual and trauma is unique.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of Avoidance may include physically avoiding people, activities, or places that remind the individual of the particular traumatic event, or simply trying to avoid thinking about the event(s) that took place.</p>\n<p>Negative changes in thinking and mood can include negative thoughts about the self or the world, hopelessness about the future, memory lapses, lack of interest, and feeling emotionally numb, among other things.  </p>\n<p>Finally, changes in physical and emotional reactions may include symptoms such as being easily startled, always being on-guard in case of danger, self-destructive behavior (e.g. drinking excessively, driving too fast), irritability, or even sometimes aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>As if the trauma itself wasn't already enough, people who experience PTSD live significantly altered and hampered lives as a result of that trauma. PTSD is a pretty complicated disorder as far as symptoms and treatments go, but this should give you the basis for understanding and possibly even identifying it in the world.</p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/ptsd.jpg' alt='Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The post traumatic stress monsters were once part of a race of benevolent guardians who became corrupted by a painful and unknown malady. Left a twisted shell of their former selves, the monsters began to crave the intense rush of fear and trauma to dull their own pain much like a drug.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monsters can be found stalking battlefields or lurking near traumatic events and natural disasters, feeding off the collective trauma and fear. They will then seek out individuals involved and stalk them, becoming a constant reminder of that pain. Victims are forced to relive the terrifying moment over and over again while the monster feeds on the destructive energy. The PTSD monster is part of the same family as the anxiety monster.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of PTSD is overall a really great illustration in my opinion, though the story accompanying it seems like a bit of a stretch. If you remember all the way back to the beginning of this volume when we saw the Anxiety monster, you'll notice how they have the same colors and both wear a skull mask. This is a really cool way of representing that they are in the same class of disorders— Anxiety Disorders, specifically. You'll also notice the arrows piercing the body of the creature, representing the wounds that have been inflicted and the trauma that has occurred.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>When thinking about relevance, the first obvious thing that comes to my mind is war veterans, but as briefly highlighted earlier, trauma can take many forms (e.g. abuse, losing a pet, untimely death, etc.).

If they haven't, they likely know or have read or heard about who has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event.</p>\n<h4>Bottom Line</h4>\n<p>Let kindness be the default when you interact with people (difficult people especially).

You've likely heard or overheard at least one person in your lifetime say something to the effect of \"Your'e so bipolar, can you just make up your mind?\" Or maybe you yourself have even said something like this. We've covered in a few of the previous editions why statements like these are destructive, so I won't elaborate too much here besides to encourage you not to call people 'bipolar' or to diminish the severity of the disorder (and the reality of those who suffer from it) by using it in contexts as trivial as the example above.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h3>\n<p>Bipolar Disorder, also known as Manic-Depressive Disorder, is a condition in which an individual experiences extreme shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and ability to carry out daily tasks. We've noted in previous editions that many of these mental health conditions significantly disrupt daily activities, and this condition is no different. I often see and hear Bipolar Disorder misrepresented in our society (you can read about my gripe with Gucci Mane's rap song \"BiPolar\" in the Community Relevance section), most often related to people who change their minds often or seem to change emotional states from being happy to being sad very quickly. We're going to throw that out of the window and get down to what Bipolar Disorder is really about.</p>\n<p>To get a general understanding of BD, there are 3 words we need to understand: Mania, Hypomania, and Depressive. Mania is a state of high energy and abundant excitement, and also potentially irritability, recklessness (in terms of decision-making), and delusions or hallucinations. Hypomania is a version of mania where the individual doesn't experience the hallucinations and everyday life is not heavily affected, but they still experience the high energy and excitement. The Depressive state is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness, a loss of interest in living, feeling no pleasure at all in life, loss of energy, and decreased ability to concentrate, among other things.</p>\n<p>There are a number of different subcategories of Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar 1 Disorder, Bipolar 2 Disorder, Cyclothymic Disorder, Cushing's Disease, etc.) in which individuals exhibit these 3 different states in varying degrees and for varying lengths of time, but for the most part, Bipolar Disorder is centered around these 3 states. As you can see, the disorder is far more complex than \"changing one's mind\" or \"mood swings\". Someone can experience a manic episode and not actually be particularly 'happy' about anything, just as someone can experience a depressive episode and not be particularly 'sad' about anything. </p>\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/bipolar.jpg' alt='Bipolar, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Bipolar, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Bipolar Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The bipolar monster is in fact two opposing consciousnesses fighting for control over one body. One consciousness expresses a constant state of mania, feeling very excitable and overactive, while the other is forever in a low and depressive state. usually, only one personality has control at any given time, while the dormant side fights to take over the body.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>They use gaseous pheromones to dominate and attempt to take over their shared body, influencing anyone that is in close proximity to the monster and passing the dominant state over to the victim. The victim will then experience alternating states like the monster itself. This monster is extremely quick and agile, making it very difficult to identify.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a great depiction of the disorder, and the idea of two opposing consciousnesses really captures the essence of have two polar opposites (\"bipolar\", two poles) in one physical space. I would question the part about \"one personality\" having control though, because bipolar disorder is more so about a single person in different states, rather than a single person displaying different personalities. The latter is actually Dissociative Identity Disorder (also known as Multiple Personality Disorder).</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>There have been a number of celebrities who have made known that they struggle with Bipolar disorder (included in <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/ss/slideshow-celebrities-bipolar-disorder\">this list from WebMD</a> are Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, Jimi Hendrix, and Winston Churchill). It isn't an easy condition to talk about, but making the world aware of their experiences has brought about a more profound public interest in mental health and what we can do about improving its current situation in the world. Things like this are great advancements for mental health, but then we have expression on the opposite end of the spectrum that completely ruin everything we are working so hard to change. </p>\n<p>In this instance, I'm referring specifically to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrJXOmqviiw\">Gucci Mane's song \"BiPolar\"</a> featuring Quavo. If you haven't heard it yet, check it out at the link so you'll know what I'm talking about here (the link goes to a YouTube account's version other than Gucci Mane's original because I wanted the clean version). I do love the track itself without words— in fact, it's one of the more catchy beats I've gotten stuck in my head— but the overall messaging is very destructive.</p>\n<p>I'll highlight a few of the problematic parts of the song (almost all of it is problematic, really) and briefly explain why they are so problematic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>\"Bipolar with the check (bipolar) I just put somethin' crazy 'round my neck (bipolar)\"</em></strong> — This line hits on the all-too-common misconception that people struggling with mental illnesses are \"crazy\". The word \"crazy\" is misused so often in our society that it doesn't even mean anything anymore. It seems to mostly be used to characterize something we don't understand. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Go crazy with your ex (bipolar)</em></strong> — Again, equating Bipolar Disorder (and really equating mental illnesses in general) with being or going \"crazy\". No bueno.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>I just might go crazy with my [expletive] (bipolar)</em></strong> — Yes, Gucci Mane does really drill it into our heads that he thinks that being Bipolar makes people \"crazy\". This idea of \"going crazy\" combined with mental illness is a huge step backwards in positive awareness, especially for people who don't actually know much about it to begin with and just listen to this song several times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar, man I keep on switchin' whips (bipolar)</em></strong> — I noted this earlier in this edition, but many people thing that Bipolar Disorder is just \"switching\" things. Switching one's mind about something, changing emotional state, etc. Clearly wrong, but here it is nonetheless in a song that has been listened to undoubtedly millions of times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>I just went bipolar, put my wrist on Tom Cruise (ooh)</em></strong> — I'm not sure what is implied by \"going Bipolar\", but if it is anything like \"going crazy\" (the rest of this song would indicate is the case here), it is not a positive, and is honestly very ignorant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Insane man, my stash man, it's crazy in the Range, He must be bipolar cause he can't stay in his lane</em></strong> — Equating mental illness with insanity is never okay, yet ignorance wins out here in the world of Hip Hop because it <em>sounds good</em>. We also see more plays here on the misconception that being Bipolar is just about \"changing\" things, like changing lanes while in a car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar, C-Murder, the Draco with the shank</em></strong> — Sure, C-Murder seems like a clever reference to throw into a song, but there are already enough people in the world who think mental illnesses make people violent, and putting a line in the song that obviously sounds like \"Bipolar, see murder\", without a doubt destroys the progress being made in teaching people that mental illness doesn't make people dangerous and violent. This is especially harmful for the impressionable youth who really don't know any better and who may be \"learning\" about Bipolar Disorder for the first time while listening to this song.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Swappin' out the Lamb', think I'm crazy</em></strong> — This one has been covered in a similar point above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar gang 'cause I spazz on that [expletive]</em></strong> — I don't think I have to even explain this one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Went bipolar in Chanel, went bipolar on the scale, Went bipolar on the plug, told him, \"Feed me bales\", Went bipolar on drugs, they be telling me, \"Chill\"</em></strong> — More instances of \"going Bipolar\", Gucci Mane clearly doesn't get it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though speaking about these issues in different mediums is usually great, there are clearly examples, such as this one, where people will surely get the wrong ideas about what mental illness really is because of simple ignorance. Sure, Gucci Mane may have intended to do a good thing with this track in bringing awareness to his own struggle with Bipolar Disorder (probably not, judging from the lyrics), but there should have been someone in the studio with enough awareness of mental illness to advise him that these lyrics are destructive and that he should come at it from a different angle. Maybe that did happen and he didn't listen. Who really knows?</p>\n<p>As far as our action is concerned, we can use the knowledge gained in this playbook and from other sources to make a positive difference in the conversation around mental health, and the world seems to need it now more than ever.</p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Celebrate the small wins. It's really easy to only measure the big, obvious wins in life and to just strive for those. It's great to have really big goals, but in reality, the bigger the win, the harder it is to achieve and, more often than not, a big win is made up of several small wins along the way.</p>\n<p>For me, I celebrate when I extend my hand first for a handshake, knowing how much I struggle with this. I celebrate going to sleep on time, finishing all my tasks for a day, and even making eye contact with strangers at work and smiling or saying 'hi'. Also note that \"celebrating\" doesn't necessarily mean \"eat a whole gallon of Party Time ice cream from Publix\" (that's what it used to mean for me). Your celebration can be as big or small as you want.</p>\n<p>All of these small things build into a bigger overall picture of myself that I'm striving for, but if I didn't celebrate these small wins, I may feel like I'm not even making progress. Celebrate your small wins this week and remember that <em>\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\"</em> - that Lao Tzu guy.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week, the challenge will be to use the mental health hack described above.

It's really amazing to see how many people have been keeping up and committing to learn this content. Don't be afraid to put your new knowledge to the test— try to explain the basics to your friends and family, try to identify different symptoms in the people you come across, fill in the blanks for people who haven't learned too much about these topics just yet. Knowledge isn't power until it is applied (like I say at the bottom of each of these editions :) ), so take advantage of your new knowledge as often as you can.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>What is Anorexia Nervosa?</h3>\n<p>Anorexia Nervosa (usually shortened to 'Anorexia') is a crossover between mental health disorder and eating disorder, which is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss in an individual.  People with this disorder have a fear of 'becoming fat', and struggle a lot with appearance issues, much like individuals struggling with Body Dysmorphia Disorder (which we covered last week). There are a number of possible causes for the disorder, but no definite causes have been identified as of yet. Research suggests that it may be linked to heredity, feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and inadequacy, and possibly even toxic relationships. In any case, the disorder is defined by an extreme fixation on weight loss and severe restrictions on the amount of food eaten. People with anorexia often equate 'thinness' with self-worth, and this is often a major root of the disorder.</p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/anorexia.jpg' alt='Anorexia Nervosa, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Anorexia Nervosa, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Anorexia Nervosa Abstracted</h3>\n<p>\"As a parasitic assassin, Anorexia Nervosa slowly kills its victims from the inside. This monster is almost invisible, thanks to its translucent body, but it casts its shadow on those it inhabits, causing its victims to see a warped image of themselves. It manipulates and controls its victim, convincing them to maintain a minimal body weight by restricting food intake and encouraging excessive exercise to lose what it perceives as 'extra' weight.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of Anorexia Nervosa is to make its victims destroy themselves through starvation and other health complications that arise due to its manipulation. The main powers of this monster are control and secrecy which cause its victims to try and hide their extreme habits. In order to defeat Anorexia Nervosa, its existence must be acknowledged, only then can its powers be rendered useless. It is common for Anorexia and Body Dysmorphia to work together.\"</p>\n<p>This week's creature is very visually interesting, and also very insidious. Anorexia Nervosa is one of those things that will eat away at you unless you acknowledge and address it, as noted in Allen's image. It is also definitely worth noting that Body Dysmorphia Disorder, which we covered last week, works hand-in-hand with Anorexia Nervosa. BDD you'll recall has a lot to do with fixating on a perceived flaw and going to extreme lengths to \"fix\" it or conceal it from sight. Anorexia Nervosa focuses mostly on weight and keeping it as low as sustainably possible. This is a sneaky one, and it doesn't always appear in a rail-thin body frame, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled to see if anyone you know exhibits any of the symptoms listed in the below section.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>Looking to our community, there are a number of symptoms that can help us identify anorexia in an individual. Of course, actual diagnosis should come from a professional, but your attention to others could help someone see their need to consult a professional where they otherwise may not have done so. Some of the symptoms of anorexia include:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid loss of weight over several weeks or months,</li>\n<li>Continued dieting and/or restricted eating even when thin or light in weight,</li>\n<li>Intense fear of gaining weight,</li>\n<li>Strange eating habits, such as eating in secret,</li>\n<li>Feeling \"fat\", even if underweight,</li>\n<li>Inability to realistically assess one's own body weight as through pounds or kilograms,</li>\n<li>Perfectionism and habit of being very self-critical,</li>\n<li>Excessive influence of body weight or shape on self-esteem,</li>\n<li>Depression, anxiety, irritability,</li>\n<li>Frequently ill,</li>\n<li>Wearing baggy clothing to hide weight loss,</li>\n<li>Compulsive exercising,</li>\n<li>Feeling worthless or hopeless,</li>\n<li>Social withdrawal</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Emotional Health Hack</h3>\n<p>People often feel like they complain too much or are more negative than they would like to be, but there is a case to be made for venting as a way to process emotions. Venting is not the same as complaining. Venting, when done properly, has an underlying goal, while complaining is mostly unguided expression. That underlying goal oftentimes may simply be to stop experiencing a negative emotion (or at least to diminish its strength). It may also be to better understand what it is you're feeling and find the root cause, or any of a number of different things.</p>\n<p>Think of venting like the \"exhale\" side of the breathing cycle. When we inhale, our body takes in and processes the oxygen and other particles that enter our lungs, and then we are left with particles that need to be released for us to continue functioning. Inhaling is like the act of experiencing things in life, which can then be processed in the body and registered as emotions. The toxins that result, or the negative emotions in this case, need to be released in order for us to stay healthy. I haven't come up with a name for what I want to call this concept, but I just thought of it this week so I'll have to get back to you on that ;)</p>\n<p>In order for us to remain mentally and emotionally healthy, we must breathe. To refuse to process emotions and release the negative sentiments is like a kid holding their breath until they get the toy they've been begging for. So, in short, vent like you mean it.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>If you happen to be the social-media-type, then this is the challenge for you. If you aren't, then I challenge you to a hot-dog-eating contest instead. My record is like 3 or something. Anyway, social media has become infamous for its brutal comment sections and indifferent users, as well as interactions devoid of meaningful sentiments (I didn't want to get all poetic, but can we just take a minute to think about how pointless 'likes' are?). That is... until this challenge! If you're anything like me, you've been guilty of scrolling through your friends' photos, maybe liking a photo or post, maybe not, and not saying anything.</p>\n<p>I challenged myself a few weeks ago for a few days to comment something positive on every post I saw (aside from the popular comedy pages I follow... ain't nobody got time for that). As you might imagine, I got tired quickly and got off social media (unintended win), but for the time I was on it, I found myself really making the effort to comment something meaningful on each post (which was admittedly tough, because some of the people I'm friends with on Facebook whose posts came up are almost perfect strangers and I don't know how or why they are on my friends list). I found myself being more empathetic, more likely to think about the person behind the post and the actual human life being lived outside of the context of that post. I had forgotten about this idea until I got around to writing this week's challenge, but I think it's time to start it up again!</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/anorexia-nervosa/mental-health-anorexia-nervosa#1\">Anorexia Nervosa — WebMD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591\">Anorexia Nervosa — Mayo Clinic</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"Aug 11, 2019","title":"DMH: Anorexia Nervosa","imageUrl":"/img/newsletters/anorexia-400p.jpg","imageAltText":"Anorexia Nervosa","featured":false,"newsletterVolume":"2","contentType":"newsletter","tags":["Anorexia Nervosa"],"keywords":"Anorexia Nervosa","description":"What is it about Anorexia that makes it so powerful, and how does it work?","unsplashBadgeInfo":{"artistName":"","artistUrl":""},"author":{"name":"Elgin Davis","role":"Main Content Writer","summary":"Elgin Davis is the creator of Winter Hearth Studios.

No major updates from this side, so let's get right to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Body Dysmorphic Disorder</strong> is a mental disorder where an individual will obsess (remember obsession from the OCD edition?) over a physical flaw— whether perceived, imagined, or real— for hours and hours each day. Many of us have something that we wish we could change about our appearances and other similar insecurities, but those qualms don't always necessarily disrupt our daily lives. This is the case of BDD.</p>\n<p>Are you starting to notice a pattern with mental disorders we've been covering in this volume? These disorders are all very disruptive to daily life and they are often time-consuming as well. With BDD, sometimes the object of fixation goes regularly unnoticed by others, but for the individual, it's prominent and is very often at the forefront of their mind— whether they want to think about it or not (I'd imagine they would rather not think about a flaw so constantly, if at all).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned briefly above, the individual will obsess over this perceived flaw, much as individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder do. Individuals with BDD may even perform compulsive and repetitive behaviors to try to hide or improve their flaws (think wearing certain types of clothes, avoiding mirrors, repeatedly checking mirrors for signs of improvement, excessive grooming, skin-picking, etc). BDD is distinguishable from OCD in that BDD deals exclusively with appearance, whereas OCD typically does not. People with BDD may also avoid social situations, in a similar fashion to individuals with social anxiety disorder, to attempt to avoid shame or embarrassment with their appearance. </p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/bdd.jpg' alt='Body Dysmorphic Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Body Dysmorphic Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Body Dysmorphic Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"As a master of deception, Body Dysmorphic Disorder loves to work in concert with other monsters such as OCD, Anxiety, and Anorexia, amplifying their effects. With broken-glass-like shards on its abdomen, it acts like a distorted mirror, reflecting a false view of whoever looks into its reflective surface. This mirrored monster then weaves a web to trap its victim like a spider, and slowly eats away at their self-esteem and overall wellbeing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This causes the victim to become increasingly worried or preoccupied about a particular part of their body or overall appearance. They begin to believe that their distorted version is the truth. Victims will often try to conceal what they think is a defect, or worse, actively seek to change it themselves.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of Body Dysmorphic Disorder hits on the defining characteristic of the disorder: appearance. It's not that the individuals are conceited, narcissistic, or full of themselves, but in fact it's the complete opposite. The description makes this clear when it notes that the monster \"eats away at their self-esteem\". This a super interesting way to represent such a disorder, but it really resonated with me and some of the things I experience with social anxiety disorder that I noted a few weeks ago.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>BDD affects about 1 in 50 adults in the United States. That's like having a whole state's worth of people on average (... looking at you Wyoming... why is Wyoming still a state?) who suffer from this disorder. It usually first appears in adolescence which, if you've been inside an American middle school or high school, makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>Opinions aside, the causes of BDD are generally unknown, as is the case with many of these mental disorders, but researchers are inclined to believe genetics, environment, trauma, and neurobiological factors (like serotonin) may be at play to some degree. \"Body Positivity\" is a major wave that has been on the rise in recent years, and it probably has to do with BDD at some level. I don't have any concrete tips for BDD (the links in the resources section have plenty of info on treatment and such), but the goal here is that you understand BDD at a basic level and can identify it in the world, and possibly help point an affected individual onto the right path to get the best help available.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Puzzles, though adored by some and avoided by many, are deemed to be pretty useful ways of \"exercising\" the mind. With puzzles, the journey is more important than the destination, because the process of solving the problem is what allows your brain to stretch itself and draw new connections between different ideas and ultimately arrive at a solution. Some research suggests that solving puzzles can slow the degenerative effects of aging on the brain and also aid in the learning process.</p>\n<p>Puzzles don't always have to be games, though. Non-traditional puzzles can be used to stimulate our minds. Some worldly puzzles that I'm currently working on \"solving\" are learning German (which to me currently sounds like someone speaking with a mouth full of loose teeth), learning digital drawing, and learning animation. For each of these endeavors, the process of learning is like starting with a box of scattered or missing puzzle pieces and finding and connecting all of them one-by-one until the picture is complete (by whatever goal I set for myself). There's a certain childlike wonder and fascination I have with learning something new and, as it turns out, there are some added mental health benefits for doing this as well.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is a simple writing challenge: Write down 10 things that you like about yourself. These things don't necessarily have to be physical. If this doesn't seem super difficult to you, that's great, because if we're ever going to reach a point of body positivity, we have to be able to recognize what we do like about ourselves as much or even more so than the things that we don't like.</p>\n<p>Many people struggle to appreciate themselves for who they are, and they struggle to feel comfortable in their own skin. If you've ever felt like this (I know I have), this would be a great challenge for you to start shaping your mind and your mental habits. Of course, there will always be things we want to improve about ourselves, but we can begin to address those things in a healthier way once we develop a healthier perspective.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook!

When we really begin to dive deep into the cosmos of mental health and we cultivate a richer understanding of these different ways that the body and mind can work for us as well as against us, we also begin to see things differently. We begin to see the humans around us in a new light. We begin to awaken to the internal dealings that people struggle with that we may have no idea about. We reach a new level of awareness in our heart that leads us to consider the other before passing judgment. Our collective voice begins to shift from one of passivity to one of strength and confidence, eager to protect and defend those who have been labeled, ridiculed, harassed, and mistreated their whole lives by a seemingly cold, unfeeling, uncaring, and uninterested world.</p>\n<p>I believe that on the other side of our journey to understand mental and emotional health is a personal evolution— an internal evolution that begins in the heart, flows up through the mind, and manifests itself as love, empathy, and compassion in the physical world. It's also a personal revolution— a revolution against siding with the status quo and allowing society to continue to look down on our neighbors who struggle with these unseen conditions each day. The love we want to see is the love we have to give. The promise of this journey is what inspires me to write these editions each week, and what keeps me pouring into this project.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What is Schizophrenia?</h3>\n<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects the way an individual interprets reality, leading to a distortion in how they think, act, express emotions, and relate to others. <em>\"Positive Symptoms\"</em>, or symptoms that are present in people with schizophrenia and not in the general population, include hallucinations, thought disorders, delusions, and movement disorders. <em>\"Negative Symptoms\"</em>, or symptoms associated with disruptions to normal behaviors and emotions, include reduced emotional expressiveness, reduced feelings of pleasure in daily life, difficulty participating in and sustaining activities, and disorganized speaking. There are also cognitive symptoms that affect the individual's ability to understand and retain information. </p>\n<p>Schizophrenia is often confused with split- or multiple-personality disorders, though they are not the same thing. People with schizophrenia often times cannot distinguish what is real from what is being imagined, and the world begins to feel like an ocean of thoughts, noises, and images, in addition to the ones that actually occur in reality. In the short YouTube video from the National Alliance on Mental Health (linked in Resources section at the bottom), they give a pretty striking example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Imagine you're sitting in a room surrounded by 100 televisions, all on different channels with the volume turned all the way up. Now, try to concentrate on one of the televisions. Try to make out one single sentence. Now, imagine having that much noise in your head every minute of every hour of every day. Welcome to reality for 2.4 million American adults living with schizophrenia.\"</em> - <strong>National Alliance on Mental Health</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They go on to note that for one individual it may be noises, but for another it may be some sort of other effect. The main distinguishing feature of someone who has schizophrenia is the loss-of-touch with reality, brought on by the different internal functioning of the nervous system. Direct causes of schizophrenia are not crystal clear at the moment, but genetics, malnutrition before birth, defects in the brain's neurotransmitters, and substance abuse are currently believed to have some sort of connection to the roots of the disorder. The resources at the bottom of this edition give very solid information on the ins-and-outs of the topic if you're looking to learn more.</p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/schizophrenia.jpg' alt='Schizophrenia, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Schizophrenia, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Schizophrenia Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The schizophrenia monster is a vile creature that manipulates its victims into doing its bidding. It uses hallucinogenic gases secreted [from] the pores on his underbelly to control and influence others to do what it wants. Its victims relate to the monster as a powerful and controlling voice inside their subconscious.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It is often accompanied by other monsters such as Paranoia, with Schizophrenia taking up an authoritative role much like a mafia gang leader. They are rarely seen and like to hide in the shadows.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of Schizophrenia is really helpful in that he highlights that the character combines other mental disorders to produce various effects in different individuals. He also makes consistent use of the term 'victim' throughout all of these monster depictions, which seems to imply a sense of helplessness on the part of the individual. Many of these mental illnesses cannot be cured, per se, but the individuals who struggle with them can be treated and the effects can be mitigated to an extent.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>Back in Volume 1 of this publication (<a href=\"/newsletters/volume-1/whats-in-a-word/\">Issue 12, specifically</a>), I highlighted a deeply moving TED Talk from Elyn Saks, a university professor who struggles with two mental illnesses. She lives with schizophrenia and psychosis, and during the talk she gives us an overview of what it is like to struggle with such conditions, and to still continue to succeed and push forward to change the world around her.</p>\n<p>One of the key moments for me from this talk was when Saks notes that she would rather be called “someone who has schizophrenia,” rather than “a schizophrenic,” or, even worse, “a schizo”. People throw around terms like these often, but we as a community should be aware of how that usage affects individuals living with those illnesses (from the voices I’ve heard so far, it doesn’t make them feel  very good at all).</p>\n<p>This concept applies the same for any mental illness, and more generally for anything that people struggle with. Labeling people can often be harmful, even though it may be an unintended consequence. My biggest piece of insight here is to consider those consequences before you label someone, and to choose your language more carefully and thoughtfully.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>In a word, adventure.

Life can get pretty stale sometimes, especially when we fall into the same daily routine and begin to find ourselves just \"phoning it in\" and going through the motions. It's easy to lose motivation and inspiration in times like these, and a lack of adventure can put your mind into a pretty dense fog.</p>\n<p>I've been having that exact feeling since the newness of my summer in Düsseldorf wore off a few weeks ago, and so this weekend I finally got out of the city and took a solo day trip to Cologne, a nearby German city. Cologne was cool and all, but what was even more exciting for me was the thrill of plunging headfirst into a new place, trying out (and failing with) my burgeoning German speaking skills, and just shaking things up. It ignited a sort of fire in me that I've missed since I left Boston, where I used to drag my friends along (willingly or unwillingly) on adventures throughout Massachusetts. If you feel like you're in a bit of a rut, it may be time for you to lace up your shoes, strap up your backpack, and take life for a nice little joyride.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>Mantras are pretty powerful, not only because of the truth they bear, but also because they are short and easy to remember. If there was one thing you wanted yourself to remember this week what would it be? For me, this week my mantra is going to be \"Have faith in the unseen\". This isn't really coming from a spiritual perspective, but rather from the perspective of a content creator.</p>\n<p>I sometimes get discouraged when I'm unable to see how my work is actually impacting people. It is tough sometimes to keep going when you get the feeling that nobody is really listening, but this week I want to remind myself to have faith that the work, energy, and passion that I'm putting out into the world is reaching the people that it is meant to reach, when it is meant to reach them, and that it's resonating with them in the ways that it's meant to resonate.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook!

I'm so glad to hear about the different ways that these weekly writings have been impacting you all and inspiring you to engage in your communities. It's wild to think about how a few months ago I started this publication as a way to share poetry with my family, and now each week we're diving into mental health concepts that will change the world, even if only on an individual level. </p>\n<p>This week we're taking a look at Sleep Disorder, so let's get started.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What are Sleep Disorders?</h3>\n<p>There has been extensive research done on sleep in the past few decades, and it has become very evident just how important sleep is for living healthy and engaged lives. Sleep Disorders are a group of conditions that affect an individual's ability to regularly sleep well. Many people experience trouble sleeping in some form, but there are specific symptoms that most likely indicate a sleep disorder, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Irritability and/or sleepiness during most days</li>\n<li>Difficulty staying awake during non-intense tasks (reading, watching TV, sitting still)</li>\n<li>Falling asleep often while driving</li>\n<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\n<li>Slow reaction speed</li>\n<li>Trouble controlling emotions</li>\n<li>Feeling the need to take a nap almost every day</li>\n<li>Being dependent on caffeinated beverages to get through most days</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/528d169e-009f-4701-a72d-a9a06092ebf1.gif' alt='Sleepless night'>\n</div> \n<p>There are a number of sleep disorders, and they each have fairly unique effects. Here are some of the most common sleep disorders:\nInsomnia— inability to sleep at night\nSleep Apnea— an individual's breathing temporarily stops during the night, awakening them frequently\nNarcolepsy— uncontrollable daytime sleepiness\nRestless-Leg Syndrome (RLS)— irresistible urges to move one's legs throughout the night\nShift Work Sleep Disorder— an individual's work schedule and biological clock are out-of-sync, most commonly seen in individuals who work night shifts, early morning shifts, or rotating shifts.\nDelayed-Sleep-Phase Disorder— biological clock is significantly delayed, leaving the individual to be unable to sleep earlier than 2am-6am every day.\nNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder— an individual's Circadian Rhythms are not synced with the natural cycles of day and night (imagine your body thinking that there were 25 hours in a day), leading them to go to sleep significantly earlier or later every day until they eventually come full circle around the clock, and the process repeats. </p>\n <br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/sleep-disorder.jpg' alt='Sleep Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Sleep Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Sleep Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Sleeping Disorder Monster is a playful creature that never rests. It will seek out a playmate or victim in the middle of the night and keep them awake to satiate its eternal boredom. Most often, the victim will get very little sleep, if any at all, stressing the victim and encouraging other monsters to join in with its games.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If the monster finds its playmate already asleep, it will become enraged and will play a variety of nasty or harmful tricks on its victim. It can induce nightmares or night terrors by burning incense from its tail. It can cause sleep apnea by wrapping its tusk around the victim's neck. It can even sit on various body parts to temporarily paralyze its unwilling playmates. These are just a few of the many tools at this monster's disposal.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One thing I like about this depiction by Allen is that it shows how there are multiple types of sleep disorders, represented by the different \"tricks\" that the monster plays on its victims. The character itself does look a bit nightmarish and dream-like itself, which connects well with the idea of sleep. It's also pretty important to note how Allen describes the monster as a \"playful creature\". In past editions where we looked at major anxiety disorders, the disorders were largely driven by some sort of biologically-induced fear (OCD, Social Anxiety Disorder), whereas with sleep disorders, we don't have that same element of fear.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>Sleep disorders are real, and it's often more than just a matter of telling your friends and family to \"go to sleep earlier\". Last week I alluded to an example of people giving advice around mental health issues that they simply don't understand. The advice generally isn't helpful since it is not coming from a place of actually understanding the underlying issues, though the individual usually means well in offering advice. Telling someone with a sleep disorder to just go to sleep earlier is about as helpful as me trying to tell a plant how to grow. I'd imagine the same idea applies to most instances where people give advice, but especially as it relates to mental health we should seek to be more understanding and to be better listeners.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/92c584ac-71ba-4c1e-afc0-259307d7abb2.gif' alt='Your friends give you bad advice' />\n</div>\n<p>If you really want to help someone dealing with sleep disorder or any other mental health disorder, read up on the disorder that they have. Learn more about what your friend is really struggling with and what they actually need from you (which is probably not more advice). Help them find a licensed professional that can address the underlying issues. Educate others (gently, of course) on your learnings around mental health. You have so much power to change the landscape of mental health, and it all starts by being curious and having the boldness to act on that curiosity. </p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>The Mental Health Hack of the week is to make what I call \"Mood Playlists\". A Mood Playlist is basically a collection of songs (I use Spotify) that all align with a certain mood or emotion that you want to feel, exaggerate, or even pull yourself into. When I'm feeling low-energy, I have a playlist to get me hyped up and ready to continue. When I'm just relaxing, I have a playlist for that too. When I'm feeling a bit blue, I have a specific playlist that I listen to to experience that emotional connection and hear something some other human created while experiencing something similar that I can relate to at that moment.</p>\n<p>Music allows us to feel and express things that we may not have been able to come up with in our own words or imagine for ourselves, and it's a wonderful gift to be able to maneuver through different emotional states with the aid of music.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is simple, but simple doesn't always mean easy. This is something that I've been trying to challenge myself to do recently, and it is certainly not easy! The challenge is this: Use the word 'I' less than 20 times each day. Now, why is this a worthy challenge? The way it makes sense to me is that the more time we spend talking about ourselves in conversation, the less time we allocate to practice empathy and learn about the other person in conversation.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/9a028e7e-3e4f-426a-abfd-1601136eb233.gif' alt='I can't help myself! GIF'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I was talking with a friend (see how easily that 'I' slipped in there?) about how in a conversation, each response has the ability to be a pull response, in which the individual pulls the attention toward themself, or a push response, wherein the individual pushes the spotlight to the other person or people. Make note of how often you pull, versus how often you push. Roughly speaking, the more you can shift the conversation to the other person, the more you can learn about them and get to know them better, while at the same time increasing your skillset for empathizing with others. Maybe you don't get down to 20 I's in a week, or even a month, but by keeping track, you'll at least become conscious of how often you pull the attention toward yourself in a conversation and you'll know exactly where to begin developing.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook!

This is because I actually struggle with Social Anxiety Disorder myself. Admitting you struggle with a mental health concern doesn't always have to be this heavy, silence-and-awkward-conversation-inducing event as it's made out to be so often in society and in the media. This isn't some Alcoholics-Anonymous-meeting style of admittance (Hi everyone. Hi. I'm Elgin and I have Social Anxiety Disorder. Hi Elgin.). It's really just me making you aware of something that I personally struggle with in my day-to-day life, just as we all struggle with things on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>As I've been noting in the past few editions, our mental health concerns don't define who we are as people, and Social Anxiety Disorder doesn't define me, though I happen to experience it first-hand. I'll take you through a bit of what that's like for me later in this edition. I'm not going to use the acronym, because that would just be SAD (sorry, low-hanging fruit).</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What is Social Anxiety?</h3>\n<p>Social Anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders in the world. It is estimated that about 15 million American adults have Social Anxiety Disorder. In the first edition of Volume 2, we covered anxiety disorders in general, and we noted that there are 5 types of Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. You might recall that an anxiety disorder is usually debilitating, paralyzing, or crippling in some way, and can greatly inhibit the victim's ability to carry on regularly in their every day life.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/b622a5a5-6968-4335-95e0-8e56001f2df0.gif' alt='Interesting blob person lying awake at night, blinking'/>\n</div>\n<p>When people first hear or learn about social anxiety, they usually lump it in the same category as 'shyness'. However, there are a few key differences that we need to take into account. The first difference is that shyness is a personality trait, while social anxiety is a condition that exists on a chemical level. Individuals like myself who struggle with social anxiety disorder aren't necessarily shy, though people who don't fully understand how it works often label me and others as being shy. Social anxiety is usually driven by an increase of adrenaline, which leads to an increased heart rate, and cortisol, which is the primary stress hormone. People who have SA experience these increases primarily in social situations as the brain determines that these situations call for a serious biological response. The second major difference between SA and shyness is that SA is also rooted in fear of some unwanted event happening, though the fear is often irrational and unwarranted.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/3d07bdd6-8a10-4fcf-b3a5-4a8e1a1eddb8.gif' alt='Spongebob hyperventilating'/>\n</div>\n<p>A common theme that you'll see with many mental health concerns is that rationality cannot always simply overpower the biochemical wirings of the brain. As such, many people, including me, struggle with how their brain is currently wired.</p>\n<p>People who have Social Anxiety Disorder usually have trouble in one or more of the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talking to strangers</li>\n<li>Dating</li>\n<li>Speaking in public</li>\n<li>Making eye contact</li>\n<li>Entering rooms</li>\n<li>Using public restrooms</li>\n<li>Going to parties</li>\n<li>Eating in front of other people</li>\n<li>Going to school or work</li>\n<li>Starting conversations</li>\n<li>Physical human contact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And they typically have an overwhelming fear of at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being judged by others in social situations</li>\n<li>Being embarrassed or humiliated</li>\n<li>Accidentally offending someone</li>\n<li>Being the center of attention</li>\n<li>Major symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder include:</li>\n<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>\n<li>Muscle tension</li>\n<li>Dizziness and light-headedness</li>\n<li>Stomach trouble</li>\n<li>Inability to catch one's breath</li>\n<li>\"Out-of-body\" sensation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with SA may start having symptoms immediately before an event, or they may begin worrying about it for weeks before the event ever happens. After the event, they might spend countless hours and lots of mental energy worrying about their social performance and mulling over their choice of actions.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/43c49082-25f3-411e-8e12-505f0d41e727.gif' alt='Crying gumball machine boy'/>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Story Time</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways that are believed to lead to the development of Social Anxiety Disorder, including an overactive amygdala (the part of the brain that controls the fear response), or a history of abuse, bullying, or teasing. There's one moment in particular in my life that I seem to be unable to shake that seems to exist at the very beginning of my social anxiety. When I was maybe 3 or 4 years old, I was in pre-school somewhere in South Florida. It was a warm autumn day, maybe even a Tuesday, and I had gummy snacks for snack time. Boy, was I excited for those gummy snacks. We started snack time and I got out my gummy snacks, ready to go to town. I started trying to open it, but it proved to be more than a little difficult for my baby-carrot fingers at the time. I pulled and pulled, until finally the bag burst open and the gummies flew in all directions all over the floor. So what did I do next? Yep, you guessed it. I started crying. Just kidding, I really wanted those gummies. Instead of standing there crying, I bent down to the floor and popped the gummies into my mouth, one-by-one, carpet hair and all. I wasn't at all prepared for what happened next. Everybody in the entire class had stopped what they were doing and all 40+ eyeballs were fixed on me, watching me eat food off the floor. The blank stares were then followed by waves of \"Ew, that's gross!\" and \"You're nasty!\", and even the teacher added in a \"That's gross, what are you doing???\" As you could imagine, I was thoroughly humiliated, and for a 3-year-old boy, such a moment does quite a number on the brain and psyche.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7f77e480-fcd1-4565-9471-5fbac1a36c27.gif' alt='Crying gumball machine boy'/>\n</div>\n<p>Ever since then, I have this looming fear of failing (and thusly being ridiculed or humiliated) in social situations such as that one. My phone alarm went off one day in one of my computer science lectures in college (back when I went to lectures) and the anxiety, sweat, and adrenaline consumed me so much that I just got up and went home in the middle of class. I touch my face probably no less than 200 times a day out of fear that there is something on my face that nobody told me about and that people will ridicule me for. I get cold sweats anytime we go around a room and have to introduce ourselves, fearing the thought of stumbling over my name or not even being able to articulate who I am to a room full of strangers. I have a huge anxiety around physical contact, and fear messing up handshakes, making incidental eye contact with strangers (or even people I know, really), being that 'really awkward hugger guy', or just being a weirdo when it comes to platonic touch (like touching someone's shoulder) in conversation all plague me on a daily basis. Sure, these fears may seem irrational. That's because they probably are, but the thing with mental disorders is that rationality usually doesn't get a say in the matter when the biochemical responses are in charge.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/social-anxiety.jpg' alt='Social Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Social Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<p>I spent a good bit of time on the above section, so I'll keep this one short. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Social Anxiety monster spends most of its life underground or in secluded sheltered areas. Because of this their skin appears pale and anaemic apart from hard plates that serve as an unnecessary means of defence. They are from the same biological family as the anxiety and paranoia monsters but due to their extreme way of life they have evolved to look quite different.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monster spends most of its time in hibernation but will project their auras into human hosts, in the hope of living out the ordinary lives they can never have. In the process, the monster passes its own anxieties to its victims so both monster and the human host experience similar irrational social fears or worries.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really resonate with the \"unnecessary means of defence\" piece, because for the most part, nothing bad will usually happen as a result of what people with social anxiety actually fear. It's also a very characteristic piece, with the monster literally turning its back to us, shielding itself from any interaction with others.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>As noted in the definition section, about 15 million adults in the U.S. have Social Anxiety Disorder. There are plenty of people for us to help, we just have to look a little harder and approach the situations in different ways. I'll start with the most unhelpful thing we can do. For myself in particular, when I'm talking about something I'm struggling with related to my anxiety, the most unhelpful things people say to me include \"it's all in your head\" or \"you're just overthinking things\", or worse, \"stop being so negative/anxious all the time\". I'd say that these things are generally unhelpful for anyone with a mental disorder, and they show a lack of true empathy or really any kind of intent to understand. People struggling with social anxiety disorder don't need you to tell them what to do or how to think and certainly not how to feel, and if we're being completely honest, most of the people giving out these instructions and bits of advice don't really know what they are talking about anyway, though their intentions may be pure.</p>\n<p>What they need from you instead is simple. Love and support. Be there to listen. Make them feel heard, listened to, and understood. You probably don't understand their anxiety if you don't experience it for yourself, so telling them what to do about it really doesn't make any sense. They need your love more than they need your advice. Comfort them when they are feeling anxious. Don't pressure them to do anxiety-inducing things. Notice when they are showing signs of being anxious (for me, I think it'd be really nice for someone to see me rubbing my face and to gently tell me \"Hey, you're okay. There's nothing on your face. All good.\"). Ask them questions. Get them to open up about their anxieties so that you can comfort them in those situations. In essence, just be a friend.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>The Mental Health Hack of the week is to create something that helps you express something you've been feeling. The creation can be anything— a drawing, a painting, some music, some writing, a poem, a story, a list— just something that you enjoy doing that also addresses a major emotion you've been feeling over the past week. I've been able to do this with the characters I've been drawing, and just manifesting those thoughts and feelings in another form allows me to engage with them in a way that I can't exactly do internally.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is simply to notice. I challenge you to pay specific attention to the emotional states of others around you. How do you think they are feeling? Why might they be feeling that way? What questions could you ask to help them? Do you care how they feel? Why or why not?

The current conversation around it is probably the most glaring example of negative discourse surrounding mental health, and that's something that this publication seeks to change through increased awareness, deeper understanding, and concrete action. Let's take a closer look at what the term \"ADHD\" really means, and what we can do to make the conversation more positive.</p>\n<h3>What is ADHD?</h3>\n<p>As many people know, ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and it is one of the most common mental disorders that affect children, though it also affects adults. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that about 8.4 percent of children and 2.5 percent of adults have ADHD. The manifestations of ADHD, like most of the other mental health topics that we address in this volume, begin on biological and chemical levels (this is also why medication is often used and is effective in assisting with ADHD symptoms). In the case of ADHD, the the symptoms stem from differences in the development of the brain that relate to the <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/executive-functioning-issues/3-areas-of-executive-function\">executive function areas</a> (which include ability to focus, self-control, organizational skills, use of working memory, and more), and usually begin during childhood. Adults tend to have a slightly different set of symptoms (<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#1\">which you can read about here</a>), but are generally related to things like anxiety, depression, disorganization, impulsiveness, etc. For kids, there are generally 3 categories of symptoms that result from ADHD: <strong>inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity</strong>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inattention</strong>— kids with ADHD may have a much harder time paying attention, concentrating, and focusing on any given task. They may seem absent-minded and like they are not listening for most of the time.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperactivity</strong>- think restlessness, fidgeting (those trendy fidget-spinners come to mind), and a general inability to remain still and engaged in a situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Impulsivity</strong>- this symptom often manifests itself in kids as an inability to wait for things. Patience is hard enough as it is for people without ADHD (read, this day and age is saturated with the idea of <a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/instant-gratification/\">instant-gratification</a>), and it's so much more difficult when chemicals within your brain are causing you to act in ways that you otherwise wouldn't.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a lot to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and I'd encourage you to check out some of the extra resources at the end of this edition. One of the best resources that I found when writing this was an article written by a mom who has a son with ADHD. At the time of writing, her son was 6 years old, and she recounts some of the very tough, all-too-common experiences she has had with her son's ADHD and how other people perceive them in public places. Get your empathy fix for this week and <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/community-events/blogs/what-i-wish-id-known-sooner/2016/10/20/8-things-i-wish-people-knew-about-parenting-a-child-with-adhd\">check out the article</a> to learn more about what that experience is like.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/adhd.jpg' alt='ADHD, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    ADHD, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>ADHD Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The ADHD monster is a tricky fiend that usually makes its presence known in childhood and in many cases likes to stay with its host until adulthood. The monster's fast movement, bright colouring and fluttering wings echo audio and visual stimulus to distract and draw the host's attention. This makes it hard for the host to concentrate on everyday tasks and disrupts basic or complex thought processes as their attention and thoughts jump from one thing to the next.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monster can also magnify and focus on a certain audio or visual clue or even a thought, making it hard to focus on anything outside of that one thing. ADHD's overflowing energy can also have an [effect] on the host, making them feel restless and agitated, further providing [a] distraction to everyday activities.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of ADHD is a very well-thought-out representation of what the disorder might look like if it were some sort of creature. Even the detail with the contrasting colors and vibrating glitch effect (the red and blue color channels being slightly drawn apart, as you might see when you watch a 3D movie without the proper eyewear) gives us a foothold into thinking about ADHD in a different way. Allen mentions the fast movement, distractions, and inability to concentrate on everyday tasks as we saw in the above section. You might even think of this creature as a representation of the chemical imbalance that occurs with ADHD, but most importantly, we have to realize that these symptoms are not the fault of the individual. This is where our empathy has a chance to grow the most.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>People use and misuse the term \"ADHD\" all the time, as mentioned in the intro to this edition. In short, as members of our global community, the least we can do is stop calling people \"ADHD\". It's insulting and it also minimizes the reality that it is a very real situation that many people deal with, and we should not only respect that fact, but we should do more than our fair share to help. We can help educate others, help people with ADHD with whatever they need, and even help parents who seem to have their hands full with a kid with ADHD. There are so many things we can do to help, but it all starts with a heart to want to understand and help others who may be different from ourselves.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Mental health hack of the week: writing down what you are feeling, both in negative situations and positive. it often is hard to really understand everything that goes on in our minds until we see it on paper. There's a great quote by Joan Didion: “I don't know what I think until I write it down.”</p>\n<p>The same concept applies to feelings. It's hard to understand and to accurately label and assess these feelings until we take the time to process them on paper. There's something quite magical about writing things out by hand, and this could be the one mental health hack you need to take your life to the next level.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is simple— call or text/message someone (preferably someone you know, but really it's your call) that you haven't talked to in a while (or ever) and just check in.

Sometimes all it takes is striking up an intentional conversation, sharing a post, sending a thoughtful text message to a friend, or making a good, old fashioned voice call (it's 2019, what are those?) to someone you care about to create a massive ripple of positivity and a surging wave of change.</p>\n<p>Last week we kicked-off Volume 2 with a brief introduction as to why this series exists, and a focus on understanding anxiety, anxiety disorders, and the difference between the two (if you missed last week's edition, you can find it here). As I mentioned last week, anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders worldwide, so if you yourself don't struggle with one, there's a pretty good chance that you've come across someone who does. This week, we'll uncover the most essential things for you to know about one of those anxiety disorders: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder— more popularly known as OCD.</p>\n<h3>What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?</h3>\n<p>As noted in the intro and in last week's edition, OCD is classified as an anxiety disorder, which is a class of specific psychiatric disorders that tend to involve crippling fear, worry, or apprehension, typically accompanied by compulsive behavior or panic attacks. To better understand what exactly Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is, we will separate it into its two parts: Obsession and Compulsion. According to the International OCD Foundation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>Obsessions</strong> are thoughts, images or impulses that occur over and over again and feel outside of the person’s control.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>Compulsions</strong> are repetitive behaviors or thoughts that a person uses with the intention of neutralizing, counteracting, or making their obsessions go away. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a nutshell, someone with OCD is unable to resist having recurring and usually disturbing thoughts, nor can they resist the fear, worry, or apprehension that those thoughts cause. In an attempt to quell these extreme anxieties, the individual performs repeated, sometimes even ritualistic behaviors that are intended to make the obsession stop. People with OCD understand that the behavior doesn't necessarily solve the problem, but they are unable to manage a better way to cope than a temporary suppression of the obsession. Take a look at the following illustration to see how OCD works from a high level overview.</p>\n<div class='pt-20 pb-20 text-center'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/13c3396b-954d-42d1-8481-a418e1c094e3.jpg' alt='OCD cycle chart' />\n</div>\n<p>It is important to note here that \"obsession\", as defined here, is used differently than many people use it in modern language. People talk about \"obsessing\" over something or \"being obsessed\" with something when they really like that thing— be it a new show on Netflix, a new song, a Vine or YouTube video, an app, etc. This, of course, isn't true obsession. Individuals with OCD often feel like the misuse of the terms diminish their very real struggle with OCD symptoms. </p>\n<p>With true obsession, an individual can't keep their mind from fixating on a certain thing to the point of those thoughts disrupting their daily life consistently. In the case of OCD, the fact of the matter is that people with the disorder don't even want to think about these things, nor do they want to act on these thoughts— they just want the thoughts to stop, and are compelled to doing certain things in an attempt to do so. With OCD, it's not that your friend is a \"neat freak\". They may have cleanliness as an actual diagnosed obsession, and are compelled to keep their room as clean as possible out of fear that something really bad might happen if the room is the slightest bit out of order. As we saw last week with anxiety disorders in general, the driving force of this class of mental illnesses is often fear of something disturbing, unpleasant, or unwelcome happening.</p>\n<p>Many people have \"intrusive thoughts\" from time to time, but those thoughts don't trigger extreme anxiety that interferes with life on a daily basis. The obsessions we're talking about here are time-consuming, unwanted, and get in the way of a person living the life they want to live, which is not the same thing as someone who simply likes to keep things clean or orderly because of a personality trait.</p>\n<div class='pt-20 pb-20 text-center'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/a5c689d9-75c0-4148-ac5e-58f0a0b45193.gif' alt='repeatedly straightening shoes' />\n</div>\n \nThere are a number of categories of common obsessions:\n<ul>\n<li>Contamination (ex. fear of contamination by body fluids, fear of diseases like HIV)</li>\n<li>Losing control (ex. fear of stealing things, fear of acting on an impulse to harm others)</li>\n<li>Unwanted sexual thoughts (ex. perverse sexual impulses about others)</li>\n<li>Religious Obsessions (ex. fear of offending God)</li>\n<li>Harm coming to others (ex. fear of being responsible for something terrible happening)</li>\n<li>Perfectionism (ex. concern with evenness or exactness, concern with a need to  know or remember)\nThere are also a number of categories of common compulsions:</li>\n<li>Washing and cleaning (ex. washing hands excessively, excessively cleaning household items)</li>\n<li>Checking (ex. checking that you didn't make a mistake, checking that the door is locked)</li>\n<li>Mental compulsions (ex. counting while performing tasks to end on a \"safe\" number)</li>\n<li>Repeating (ex. rereading, rewriting, repeated tapping)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A brief aside as we conclude this section— when we call someone \"OCD\" because of any of the above obsessions, compulsions, general behaviors, or really any other reason, a number of things happens. The first thing that happens is that we actually diminish the validity of the very real mental health disorder that many people suffer from by misusing the term. Another thing that happens when we call someone \"OCD\" is that, whether you realize it or not, we are identifying them by their mental illness. People who have OCD don't enjoy having it, they don't enjoy being labeled by it, and, I can't stress this enough, they are not defined by the mental illness that they suffer from. In the same way that it is ignorant to call someone with a physical limitation 'a cripple', it is also ignorant to call someone with a mental illness by their mental illness. They don't make light of it, and neither should we.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/ocd.jpg' alt='Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The obsessive compulsive monster is a cruel and manipulative puppeteer that uses fear to control its victims. It repeatedly pounds its staff on the ground and uses its patterned feathers and many eyes to hypnotise its victim, creating intense and frightening obsessions often linked to the safety of themselves or people close to them. Victims develop compulsions to carry out repetitive tasks or mental acts to prevent the obsession from coming true or to attempt to temporarily reduce the fear.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monster is almost never seen but its presence is almost always there. Anxiety and Depression monsters are often used by the OCD monster to keep a hold on its victim.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's choice to depict OCD as a puppeteer is really interesting, but I think that it fits with what has been uncovered about OCD. People with OCD are made to fear certain things taking place, and they are led to take certain actions in order to prevent those things from happening, whether the logic of it makes sense or not. Allen's description hints more toward the fear linked to the safety of the self or people close to the self, which is one of the categories of obsession that we saw in the previous section.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>As of June 2019, the term \"OCD\" is searched in Google 165,000 times per month. Like the term \"anxiety\", OCD is widely misunderstood, though hopefully you have a good understanding after reading through the above sections. In terms of the community, Help Guide gives us useful tips for supporting someone who has OCD:\n<strong>Avoid making personal criticisms</strong>- these are symptoms, not character flaws\nDon't scold someone with OCD or tell them to stop performing rituals- they cannot simply stop the compulsive behavior when they want, and you will put more pressure on them by doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Be as kind and patient as you can be</strong>- the individuals need to be able to fight the disorder at their own pace. Cheer them on in their successes and focus on the positive elements happening in their life\nDon't play along with the rituals- helping with rituals may reinforce the rituals, which is counter-effective to overcoming the disorder\nKeep communication positive and clear- let them know that you are there with them and don't add extra stress to the situation by being negative\nIn addition to these tips, there are more resources in the Resources section at the bottom of this edition.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>This week's Mental Health Hack is something I've been doing since January. After coming back from my South Africa mission trip, I was inspired to start a journal that I write in each day with the positive and negative things that happened that day. I went a step further and added a column called \"Big Moods\", which captures the major emotional states that I recall experiencing during each day. I also keep a list of emotional descriptors at the top of the file to refer to in case I am having trouble pinning down a certain emotion.</p>\n<p>This has been a good tactic for me to not only engage more deeply with the events that took place on any given day, but it offers me time and space to reflect on how those events actually made me feel, which is a major key in developing emotional intelligence. Being the nerd I can be sometimes, I put this journal into a document in Evernote as a table (much like a table you'd find in Google Docs or Microsoft Word) so that I can have it with me wherever I go, and also so that whenever I am ready, I can write code to analyze my entries for all sorts of cool insights like most common feelings, most positive months, most negative months, people who have had a profound impact on my life, etc.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>I challenge you to say 'hi' (with a smile, of course) to at least one stranger this week.

As I noted in the introductory message to this series, lots of misunderstanding,\nmiscommunication, and misrepresentation cloud the public perception of mental health, especially as it relates to mental illness. I want to kick off this series by explaining what exactly I aim to achieve.</p>\n<p>I want people to understand that \"mental health\" is just as important as physical health, and that it is not some taboo, untouchable thing that we should shy away from in conversation and avoid at all costs when it comes to members of our society. By better understanding different forms that mental health disorders can take, we will be better positioned to empathize with and assist others in our community who need our help. At the root of empathy is curiosity— curiosity to ask questions, and to seek to understand the thoughts and experiences of another person. It is this same curiosity that has brought you here to learn more about mental health, and I'm excited to learn and grow alongside you over the course of the series.</p>\n<p>I put a lot of elbow grease into this edition and it's packed with information, so be sure to save it for later reference.</p>\n<h3>What is Anxiety?</h3>\n<p>Nearly 40 million people in the U.S. (about 18% of the population) experience an anxiety disorder in a given year, and that figure is based only on information that has been reported. Imagine how many people suffer with anxiety disorders that go undocumented, undiagnosed, and unaddressed. In fact, only 1 out of 3 people who suffer from an anxiety disorder receive treatment, though the disorders are highly treatable. The World Health Organization reports that anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders worldwide (<a href=\"https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety\">ADAA 2018</a>), but they are so widely misunderstood.</p>\n<p><strong><em>So what exactly is anxiety?</em></strong> The dictionary defines anxiety as <strong><em>\"a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome\"</em></strong>. Anxiety is a fairly misused term in our society, which in turn actually leads to invalidation of the experiences that so many people actually suffer from every day. People who say things like \"I have anxiety\" or \"I'm having an anxiety attack\" must be careful not to confuse the two, because most people do not understand that being anxious and having an anxiety disorder are not the same thing. Anxiety disorders are specific psychiatric disorders that tend to involve crippling fear, worry, or apprehension, typically accompanied by compulsive behavior or panic attacks.</p>\n<p><strong><em>So what's the difference?</em></strong> Basically, common anxiety is something that we all feel, as when we are about to perform in front of a crowd, or a deadline is coming up soon at work that we are worried we might not meet, or there's a cute girl in our math class that we're too afraid to talk to. You might also fear certain things, like spiders or learning that you sat in gum and have been walking around sporting your new saliva-and-sugar-stained jeans all day. </p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/e72995b4-4d0c-492c-bdbe-46010b057141.gif' alt='Anxious cartoon animation'/>\n</div>\n<h6><em>Take a moment here to note how anxiety is usually characterized by a worry about future/impending events, while fear is often a reaction to current events.</em></h6>\n<br>\n<p>Okay, so we all get a little anxious from time to time. That is not quite an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is usually debilitating, paralyzing, or crippling, and can leave the victim unable to carry on in their every day life. </p>\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people who avoid social situations altogether for fear of being embarrassed, humiliated, or judged;</li>\n<li>people who experience unprovoked panic attacks and are constantly preoccupied with having another;</li>\n<li>people who have irrational fear of an object, place, person, or situation that in reality poses little or no threat of actual danger;</li>\n<li>and people who suffer from recurring nightmares, flashbacks or emotional numbing related to a traumatic event that happened months or even years before.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5479a144-e2d5-4beb-9345-0e723b4fbe14.gif' alt='Anxious eyes darting back and forth'/>\n</div>\n<p>Hopefully this was a helpful (and sufficiently brief) overview of anxiety, anxiety disorders, and the stark differences between the two. There are actually 5 commonly classified types of anxiety disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder (also known as Social Phobia). If you are familiar with any of these disorders, you may have recognized some of the characteristics in the above examples. We'll leave those definitions for another time, but this section should give you a pretty good insight as to what exactly comes into play when we speak of \"anxiety\" as a whole.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Real Creatures by Toby Allen</h3>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='/img/newsletters/anxiety.jpg' alt='Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Anxiety Abstracted</h3>\n<p>When I first started researching for the content of Volume 2, I came across the work of Toby Allen. Allen is an illustrator who has created depictions of these different mental health disorders in order to make mental illness appear \"more manageable\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The project originated from imagining my own anxieties as inner demons and finding it to be a cathartic and healing process to draw them... It made them feel weaker, and I was able to look at my own anxiety comically with the help of these monster drawings... I hope it helps [people] see their illness in a different light, make it appear more manageable”.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea intrigued me from the beginning, as I thought it was very interesting and also very effective to represent mental health disorders as being separate from the human, because as someone living with a mental illness, <strong>you are not your mental illness</strong>, nor are you defined by it, unless you choose to be. I loved the idea of giving life to these seemingly intangible concepts, giving us an easier, more accessible, and more <em>visual empathy entry point</em>. </p>\n<p>Playing with these characters in my mind personally makes it much easier to imagine what life experiences might look like for people struggling with various disorders. He has illustrated a number of these conditions, and there is an illustration that pairs with each one of the disorders we'll be covering in this volume.</p>\n<p>The description for the anxiety character represented above reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The anxiety monster is small enough to sit on its victim's shoulder and whisper things in to their unconscious, eliciting fearful thoughts and irrational worries. The anxiety monster is often seen as weak in comparison to others, but it is one of the most common and is very hard to get rid of.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>They often carry small objects linked to their victim's anxieties such as clocks which represent a common but irrational fear of things that might never happen. No one has ever seen the face of the anxiety monster for it always wears a skull as a mask.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg' alt='Relevance in Global Community' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>As mentioned briefly above, there are a lot of stunning statistics surrounding anxiety and anxiety disorders. According to the World Heath Organization, 1 in 13 people globally suffer from anxiety. That's about 2 kids in every elementary-through-high-school classroom, roughly 38 students in every 500-student lecture hall in college, and about 230 students in a population the size of my 3,000-student high school, on average. As I noted before, anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders in the U.S.</p>\n<p>These statistics beg the question, \"so what am I supposed to do with that information?\" The first step is awareness, which, if you've tracked with me so far in this edition, I'd say you're pretty aware of the scope of anxiety (but don't stop here, keep learning!). The second step I'd suggest is to simply listen to those around you. <a href=\"https://www.anxiety.org/what-is-anxiety\">Anxiety.org</a> makes a really strong point when they note, \"Not everyone understands that someone with an anxiety disorder cannot 'just let things go'\". If you feel so inclined to tell someone to \"just let [something] go\", consider taking a more empathetic approach instead. Ask more questions, listen to the answers, and seek to understand. Anxiety exists on a biological, genetic, and chemical level, and we as advocates should do our best to listen, learn, understand, and respect the limits of those who struggle with anxiety disorders of any kind.</p>\n<p>Step three is to learn to recognize how anxiety disorder manifests itself in other people (<a href=\"https://www.anxiety.org/what-is-anxiety#recognizing-the-disorder-in-others\">which you can find more about here</a>). Lastly, step four is to make the effort to address the needs of others who struggle with anxiety disorder. This may look like simply being present for someone as they struggle with their disorder, reaching out for professional help (<a href=\"https://www.anxiety.org/what-is-anxiety#treatment-options\">you can find a list of treatment options here</a>), or a host of other supportive options, including calming/breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, etc.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg' alt='Flowers in light bulb vases' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>This week was loaded with content, so we'll keep it light with our Mental Health Hack of the Week: <a href=\"https://www.aifc.com.au/how-important-is-water-hydration-to-mental-health/\">Drink more water</a>! It's very easy to never drink straight H2O, since we usually get \"enough\" water to survive from our other nutritional sources, but drinking more water can substantially improve our mental health. For the sake of brevity, drinking more water allows more oxygen to reach our brain, which in turn allows us to think more clearly, make better judgements, and better assess our mental and emotional states.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n            <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg' alt='Child looking at stairs' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This is a huge, and I mean HUGE, opportunity for building empathy right here.

I want to take a moment to celebrate all of the mothers all over the world (especially those who keep up with the Epic Life Playbook!) and to thank you for your love and for the sacrifices you've made to support us all. I would also like to give a special shout-out to my mom and grandma, who support me every day in these wild adventures I find myself on (and who read all of these weekly emails). I love you both dearly :)</p>\n<p>This week is all about addressing the mindset of \"positive-thinking\". Being positive is great when it's genuine, but it comes at a mental and emotional cost when this positivity is forced or fake. Instructing others to \"just think about the good things\" and to avoid addressing the negative experiences inherent to the human experience can actually do more harm to their mental and emotional health than good. Society has been operating this way for decades, if not centuries or millennia, but recent research and insights from psychologist Susan David are leading the charge in changing how we think about positive-thinking.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/NDQ1Mi5I4rg'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/video_thumbnails_new/841374ef05f19f1cbffd3c9766884a24.png' alt='Susan David at TED'>\n    </a>\n    <p>\n        The Gift and Power of Emotional Courage — Susan David\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week's Listen section is a TED Talk from psychologist <a href=\"http://www.susandavid.com/\">Susan David</a>, founder and co-director of the Institute of Coaching at McLean Hospital of Harvard University Medical School, an instructor in psychology at Harvard, and author of <a href=\"https://geni.us/9q2fB\">Emotional Agility</a>.</p>\n<p>The foundation of David's talk is the notion that putting on a mask and pretending to be positive can actually do more harm than good. One of the most interesting points she raised in the talk is the idea of suppressed amplification, where human emotions generally intensify and become much stronger over time if they are not dealt with in a timely manner. This is likely the cause of emotional breakdowns or \"meltdowns\" we see in society when someone has simply \"put up with things for too long\".</p>\n<p>To liken this idea to commonly-used idioms, the idea leads us to believe that there would never be a \"straw that breaks the camel's back\" if we routinely dealt with the straws that had already been loaded, and there wouldn't be a \"tipping point\" if we were to straighten out the cup before it is about to fall over and spill out. Her talk doesn't say necessarily that being positive is a bad thing, but it does, however, show us that it is healthier to allow yourself to express whichever emotions you are actually feeling, rather than to put on the \"I'm fine\" mask and the \"Everything is great\" shades and keep it moving, so as not to have to deal with reality.</p>\n<p>This was such a great talk, and Susan David's work on \"emotional agility\" is really fascinating and worth checking out. You can begin by watching the powerful talk she gives above. </p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://ideas.ted.com/why-we-should-say-no-to-positivity-and-yes-to-our-negative-emotions/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7562a1b3-fe3f-4a93-835a-9d349ccb5f3d.png' alt='TED logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, we continue in the same body of work of Susan David with an article entitled \"Why we should say no to positivity — and yes to our negative emotions\". The article covers a more-action oriented approach to the video from the Listen section, and we'll take a look at each of those action steps more closely in the Level Up section.</p>\n<p>The basic idea, as we have seen in the Listen section, is that being positive for the sake of being positive is not exactly healthy, because covering up negative emotions causes them to become stronger and more potent, whereas safely managing and expressing emotions as they occur is a much less-often-used and much more valuable alternative.

This is something that I noted in my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&#x26;sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee\">Medium article on empathy</a> (Tip #5 in the article), where the idea is that if you don't have the emotional vocabulary to accurately describe the feeling, you may mislabel it (i.e. when people call most negative emotions 'sad', 'upset', 'stressed', etc.), and this leads to greater confusion in trying to understand what you are feeling.</p>\n<p>Have compassion on yourself when you notice emotions. It's very common for people to beat themselves up for feeling certain emotions, seeing themselves as weak or inferior. The thing about that notion is that the human experience is not one of only positive emotions and experiences, but it also comes with a full range of negative emotions and experiences. Without having both, life wouldn't seem quite as beautiful, and the positivity that everyone seeks wouldn't be quite as valuable as it is today. Have compassion on yourself when you experience negative emotions, but the key is to address the problem and move forward, and not to dwell in the state for too long.</p>\n<p>Trace the emotion's lifespan to its source. Taking the time to understand not only what you are feeling but also why you are feeling it gives you power and advantage over that emotion. Once you realize the cause of the pain, you can treat it. Once you find the hole in the boat, you can patch it up and stop it from sinking (provided you have the right tools, which we have been building up throughout Volume 1!). In the same way, once you find the source of your pain, do not put on the mask of positivity and hide from it, but instead do what you can to address it and fix it, so you can push yourself toward true, genuine positivity.</p>\n<p>Watch your language. There was a brilliant point raised in David's talk — namely the one where she noted that something as simple as the language we use has a profound effect on how we perceive emotions. She instructs us to use more accurate language like \"I am feeling sad\", rather than something like \"I am sad\", because this small nuance can actually trick our minds into believing that we embody that emotion, rather than seeing the emotion as being something that we experience and can move past.</p>\n<p>Don't allow others to force the mask of positivity upon you. Positivity, in its true form, cannot be forced, nor can it be faked. Allowing others to tell you how you should feel hinders your ability to process an emotion or experience and actually reach genuine positivity on your own.

Gratitude is powerful. Gratitude has the power to transform entire mindsets from negative and hopeless to positive and optimistic. To be truly grateful is to appreciate every aspect of life, taking the good with the bad, and choosing to use it to move forward rather than to stay in the same place or to regress. Gratitude allows us to be humble and to understand that there are forces in this world beyond our control, and also to understand that neither our successes nor our failures come completely by our own hands. The gift of gratitude is a gift of healthy perspective, and a healthy perspective is key to enhancing your reality (check out our edition on The Pursuit of Perspective here for more on the topic).</p>\n<p>If you're reading this edition, I'm immensely grateful that you've committed time and energy to support this endeavor of mine, and I really hope that you have been inspired and empowered by the content I write for you each week.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/53fafea0-4f19-447c-90b0-a82cd8cdf767.jpeg' alt='The Gratitude Podcast'>\n</div>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week's Listen section comes from The Gratitude Podcast, an uplifting podcast hosted by Georgian Benta that aims to inspire 100,000 people to discover how to feel grateful more often and live a happy life. The episode in particular I checked out was called \"The Easiest Way To Change Your Life\" with Dave Meltzer. Meltzer is the CEO of Sports 1 Marketing, he was CEO of the world’s first smartphone, and he later became CEO of the world’s most notable sports agency, Leigh Steinberg Sports and Entertainment. These accolades become relevant in the episode, I promise.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Meltzer talks about how living in a grateful mindset, regardless of the situation, may be a guaranteed way to actually achieve happiness in life. He also denotes <strong>four pillars</strong> for living a successful life: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gratitude</strong>, which gives you a healthy perspective on life's events; </li>\n<li><strong>Empathy</strong>, which allows you to forgive and be grateful for all of the mistakes that you and others have made; </li>\n<li><strong>Effective Communication</strong>, which allows us to connect to that which inspires us, and then add value to it to in turn empower others. </li>\n<li><strong>Accountability</strong>, which allows us to take responsibility for our behaviors and ask two questions: <em>\"Did I do something to attract this thing to me?\"</em> and <em>\"What am I supposed to learn from it?\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's plenty of great wisdom in this short episode, so check it out below to learn more.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/The-Easiest-Way-To-Change-Your-Life-Dave-Meltzer-id1472375-id147055371\n'> Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://ideas.ted.com/why-we-should-say-no-to-positivity-and-yes-to-our-negative-emotions/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7562a1b3-fe3f-4a93-835a-9d349ccb5f3d.png' alt='TED logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, we explore the therapeutic effects of giving and receiving compliments. In this TED Talk by Tracie Broom, we take a deeper look into what's really going on inside of us when we give and receive compliments. With respect to gratitude, complimenting others in very specific, intentional, and genuine ways can be huge in fostering and nurturing relationships. Being thankful for the positive aspects of another person not only helps to maintain your positive perspective, but it also gives you the opportunity to empower and encourage others to do the same when you communicate your gratitude to that person in some way, as we heard similarly in the episode above from Dave Meltzer.

Making this edition of the playbook created a radical positive shift in my life perspective, so I hope that reading it will do the same for you.</p>\n<p>This week's content is all about how living in pursuit of curiosity rather than passion can actually be just what you need to live your best life. We often hear metaphors likening passion to fire, portraying it as a bright, brilliant source of energy and symbol of life and hope. That's definitely something that we try to embody here at Winter Hearth Studios, but as most of us know, there's usually more to any metaphor than meets the eye. Fire can also be destructive, of course, as we unfortunately just saw with the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France. Fire can burn, hurt, consume, and demolish if it is allowed to run its own course.</p>\n<p>Curiosity, on the other hand, does not consume us, but rather it allows us to edify ourselves and move unhurriedly through the phases of life, enjoying each moment and interacting with the world around us in a more meaningful way. (\"Curiosity killed the cat\" sounds nice and is easy to remember, but it is not really accurate...)</p>\n<p>So how can this understanding of curiosity connect you to living a better life? That's exactly what we'll aim to answer in this week's content.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bf332dd-ba71-422b-b1fa-dd4d7631b6a9.jpg' alt='Listen'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>If you consume just one piece of content this week from the ELP, this podcast should be the one. This episode comes from Oprah Winfrey's Super Soul Conversations podcast, and is led by New York Times best-selling author Elizabeth Gilbert, and it's all about the \"Curiosity-Driven Life\".</p>\n<p>I won't spoil too much about the episode, but if you're someone who struggles to find their passion in life or you feel a bit lost or overwhelmed at the current place in your journey, your biggest questions will likely be answered in this wisdom-packed episode.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Elizabeth-Gilbert%3A-The-Curiosity-Driven-Life-id1347950-id147602962?country=us'> Check out the talk</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0164d703-676a-4bad-97d4-458942a01a35.jpeg' alt='College-aged students jumping into the air together'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, we have a throwback to an article I published on Medium a while back highlighting \"8 Tips to Level Up Your Empathy Skills\". At its core, empathy is about understanding and sharing in the emotions and experiences of another person. In order to build and use this empathy, we must entertain a certain level of curiosity, leading ourselves to venture outside of our own mental frameworks and to try to wrap our minds around the emotions and experiences of another person.</p>\n<p>This curiosity may be as simple as pondering, \"I wonder what she is feeling right now.\" Whether or not you come to the correct conclusion, the simple act of engaging in that curiosity of the state of another person engages your empathic skills and allows you to pause long enough to consider the other's point of view and perspective.</p>\n<p>When imagining two people having an argument, passion usually finds itself in the mix, and that very same fiery passion usually ends up burning one or both people in the process. Genuine curiosity, however, is not consuming, nor will it burn, but it will in most instances actually lead to a greater sense of empathy and self-control for those who engage with it. Read (or re-read) the article below for a deeper look at how curiosity can radically transform your interactions.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'> Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/70851790-9a7c-4f5b-834d-7207335fe488.gif' alt='Level Up'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>This week's Level Up section explores a really great article about curiosity as a major component in successful relationships. The relationships we experience in life play a huge role in our mental and emotional health, and as we saw in the Learn section, curiosity is a driving force in building our empathy for others.</p>\n<p>You may be familiar with the social experiment \"<a href=\"http://36questionsinlove.com/\">36 Questions to Fall in Love With Anyone</a>\" (if not, familiarize yourself from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=36+questions+to+fall+in+love&#x26;rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS657US657&#x26;oq=36+q&#x26;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.2378j0j4&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">this Google search</a>). Why do scientists think that asking these 36 questions will help anyone fall in love? The basis of it, as we've seen throughout the rest of this digest, is using curiosity as a tool for building empathy. These questions are particularly personal, but in asking these questions, it seems to the answerer that you really want to get to know and understand them on that personal level, and that you are actually curious/interested in knowing the response. As the person who asks each question, you are building your ability to understand and share the emotions and experiences of others with each question asked which, as noted in the Learn section, is the very definition of empathy.</p>\n<p>This is such an awesome topic, and I hope you dig into it deeper. Perhaps you can even practice the 36 questions with yourself and get to know yourself a little better! The mentioned article does a great job at tying these ideas in with research to help us make logical sense of these phenomena, and there are a lot of solid action steps to be taken from both of these resources.</p>\n<p>tldr (too long, didn't read) — Ask personal questions of people more frequently to build better relationships.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_curious_people_have_better_relationships'> Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>This week we have a guest artist feature from a personal friend of mine who goes by the name phoxx.tail.

Imagine how difficult it must be to not only have schizophrenia and psychosis, but also to then get on stage in front of hundreds of people and talk about your journey, struggles, and life managing both of them simultaneously (taking the time and energy to try to place yourself in that position will definitely increase your empathic abilities).</p>\n<p>I strongly suggest you find the time to watch this TED Talk, but if you are unable to, there are a few major highlights for you to grab:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your language carefully - In the talk, Saks notes that she would rather be called \"someone who has schizophrenia,\" rather than \"a schizophrenic,\" or, even worse, \"a schizo\". People throw around terms like these often, but we should be aware of how that makes people living with those diseases feel (from the voices I've heard so far, it doesn't make them feel good at all).</li>\n<li>Don't criminalize mental illness - In today's society, the main place we hear \"mental illness\" blasted on the media is in cases of violence (most notably gun violence). We must understand, though, that most people struggling with mental illness, as Saks noted, are not violent. Just as the U.S. went through the phase of painting all Muslims as violent people after the actions of Al-Qaeda, the U.S. is going through a similar associative phase right now as it pertains to mental illness. Not all Muslims are violent, and not all people with mental illnesses are violent either. In fact, in both cases, and the cases of most other categories of people, the majority of the populations are nonviolent, as we'd expect.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand - This is a core tenet of empathy. Seek first to understand. People have the tendency to label those with mental illnesses instead of choosing to seeing them clearly, honestly, and compassionately.

Not only does the misuse of these terms show a lack of understanding of what these mental illnesses actually are, but it actually trivializes the situations in which an individual actually does have one of these mental illnesses and weakens our potential for deeper understanding.</p>\n<p>One of the worst perpetrators of this is music. For example, musicians (and many other people, for that matter) <a href=\"https://rudermanfoundation.org/foundation-calls-out-eminem-and-beyonce-for-use-of-the-word-retarded-in-new-song-and-to-use-their-celebrity-to-stop-bullying-of-people-with-disabilities/\">still use the word \"retarded\" in their music and speech patterns</a>, though it is an offensive term for people with intellectual disabilities and is used to bully children and adults around the world. There are plenty of other examples in pop culture, so just be aware how these phrases affect others before you use (or do not use) them.

In <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2018/05/29/5-ways-to-develop-your-emotional-intelligence/#2489cfb06976\">this article from Forbes</a>, we learn 5 concrete ways to develop our emotional intelligence. I'll outline each method below, and give an example of what this might look like for you in practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manage your negative emotions</strong>. This is one of the core tenets of emotional intelligence. The ability to recover from negative emotions will change your life drastically, because regardless of what happens to you, if you have trained this skill, adversity will lose its power over your emotional state. In practice, this often means putting life in greater perspective when negative events happen. For example, spilling a cup of coffee and being debilitated by the event for the rest of the day is not managing the emotional state correctly (please don't cry about spilled coffee... or milk... just don't do it). Instead, in developing your EQ, you might realize that in the grand scheme of life, a spilled cup of coffee is probably the least of your worries, and you collect yourself and carry on with the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Be mindful of your vocabulary</strong>. I published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790\">this article on Medium</a> a month ago, outlining 8 ways to practice empathy. This is similar to steps 5 and 6 from the article — choosing your words to accurately convey what you are thinking is crucial in developing your EQ. For you, this may mean more descriptive words, like 'frustrated', 'irritated', or 'disgusted', rather than the commonly misused word 'upset' that is used by many people today to represent most negative emotions.\nPractice empathy.  In the same Medium article referred to in the last point, I note that the most important way to practice empathy, perhaps, is to refrain from assuming things about people, especially things that seem to make sense to you but may not actually be true. The example I give in the article is the assumption that because someone hasn't responded to a text message for a few hours that they must be ignoring you or they must be upset when, in reality, you don't always know for sure what may actually be going on in someone else's life. Use your creativity instead to place yourself in the other's shoes.</li>\n<li><strong>Know your stressors</strong>. Knowing what pushes your buttons makes it easier to manage those negative emotions before they ever arise. For example, you know that you are going to be enraged if your child comes home late for the fourth time this week. When it's getting late and little Timmy isn't home yet, you may become aware of your rising stress level. You are then able to collect yourself and prepare for a more thoughtful (and less terrifying) interaction when Timmy does finally arrive past curfew.</li>\n<li><strong>Bounce back from adversity</strong>. There are plenty of trite expressions about \"bouncing back from adversity\", but there is a reason for this. The thing about adversity is, growth is necessarily uncomfortable. If we weren't pushed from our comfortable, centered emotional states, we would almost never have the opportunity to grow as people. We'd probably just stagnate, never improving or developing these skills. For example, failing a test in school or a project at work does not necessitate dropping out of school or quitting your job. No, in fact, the adversity has just shown you what you need to improve on, and when you make the choice to accept that challenge, you build up that mental muscle of resilience that will probably come in handy one day in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'> Check out the full article!</a>\n</div>\n \n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/la-sagrada-familia-23cd1ec70b67\">La Sagrada Familia</a>\" from Winter Hearth Studios.

If you've seen any form of news at any point in time, you're probably familiar with the fact that there's no shortage of terrible events happening around the world. Tragedy strikes day after day, and whether you realize it or not, each of these events you learn about and care about has an effect on you in some way, shape, or form.</p>\n<p>Though many of you have awesome, huge hearts, our compassion is sadly not unlimited and does indeed come with a cost. Compassion fatigue is generally defined as a unique form of burnout, characterized by a gradual lessening of compassion as a result of constant engagement with heavy emotional situations and challenges (<a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2011/408024/\">Jennifer R. Day &#x26; Ruth A. Anderson, 2011</a>). In other words, compassion fatigue may be described as the process of becoming desensitized to people who are suffering or are in need of help. The phenomenon is exaggerated and most commonly observed within the caregiving professions, because workers in these professions face constant \"heart-wrenching, emotional challenges\" (<a href=\"http://www.compassionfatigue.org/pages/compassionfatigue.html\">Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project, 2019</a>), such as those who deal with death and mortality on a daily basis (doctors, firefighters, police officers, etc.). There has also been some argument among journalism analysts suggesting that news media have played a large part in dramatically increasing compassion fatigue throughout our society by utilizing stories of extreme tragedy and suffering outside of their proper contexts.</p>\n<p>In short, <strong><em>caring comes with a cost</em></strong>. If you feel like you have some degree of compassion fatigue, you're certainly not alone. The great thing is that there are plenty of ways by which you can start to overcome compassion fatigue once the initial awareness is present.  Check out this week's content to learn more about compassion fatigue and to learn exactly what you need to do to overcome yours.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Cynthia-Bond%3A-%E2%80%9CRuby%E2%80%9D-(An-Oprah%E2%80%99s-Book-Club-Selection)-id1347950-id137461847'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bf332dd-ba71-422b-b1fa-dd4d7631b6a9.jpg' alt='Oprah SuperSoul logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week, we're back with Oprah and another SuperSoul conversation. In this episode, Oprah speaks with Cynthia Bond, author of the best-selling book \"Ruby\", which deals with the heavy topic of sexual abuse. Bond talks about how she uses writing to process emotions and experiences, and also to tell a powerful story that has hit home for many readers. I've yet to read the book, but I'm definitely adding it to my list.</p>\n<p>The conversation also brings us back to the idea of compassion fatigue in the sense that reading emotionally heavy, dense material can wear down on a person's mental health if they aren't aware of the effects of the content being consumed. The same idea applies to music, film, art, and anything else we consume. That is, of course, not to say that we shouldn't engage with emotionally powerful material, but rather to shed light on the fact that these things affect us in ways that we might not readily perceive, and that we must become more aware of these subtle effects in order to care for ourselves properly and maintain a solid mental health state.   </p>\n<p>Without further ado, here's the conversation with Oprah and Cynthia Bond!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Cynthia-Bond%3A-%E2%80%9CRuby%E2%80%9D-(An-Oprah%E2%80%99s-Book-Club-Selection)-id1347950-id137461847'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.ted.com/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7562a1b3-fe3f-4a93-835a-9d349ccb5f3d.png' alt='TED logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, I want to provide you with a number of links to TED Talks concerning Compassion Fatigue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsaorjIo1Yc\">Drowning in Empathy: The Cost of Vicarious Trauma</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7keppA8XRas\">How to Manage Compassion Fatigue in Caregiving</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-4m35Gixno\">Compassion Fatigue: What is it and do you have it?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These talks do a good job of defining compassion fatigue and where it occurs most often, and they even give a few tips for combatting this increasingly-common form of burnout in today's society.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/29b777ca-e504-4e39-a43c-919e0fbcbd87.jpg' alt='Woman with head down on a desk'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\">\n        Photo by Abbie Bernet on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>In this week's Level Up section, we have an <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/high-octane-women/201407/are-you-suffering-compassion-fatigue\">article published in Psychology Today</a>, further outlining compassion fatigue and giving <strong>concrete steps for dealing with this sneaky form of burnout</strong>.

The piece is entitled La Sagrada Familia, and is named after the famous, under-construction temple being built in the northern part of the city. The building has actually been under construction for 100+ years, but it's expected to finally be completed (long after its initial architect and designer has passed) around the year 2026.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 8% 0;\">\n<h1>La Sagrada Familia</h1>\n<div style=\"margin: 0 18%; text-align: left\">\n<em>\n<p>Alighting sweetly from the several stories above,<br>\nEach saint takes his turn swaying in the<br>\nCherished, cheery light of the<br>\nStained-glass windows;<br></p>\n<p>Filtering the rays of the sun as they tell<br>\nThe story of the raise of the Son from<br>\nThe calamity of unknown yet certain death into<br>\nThe calmness of unbounded, everlasting life.<br></p>\n<p>The great temple stands tall — mighty, yet unfinished.<br>\n<p>Seafoam-green shards of light<br>\nDash the ground in a dizzying spell,<br>\nWhile cherry-red drops trickle down from the<br>\nSolid, rose-colored treetops<br></p>\n<p>Which provide no shade, for the<br>\nTruest light emanates from below the unmoving trees.<br>\nFastened tightly with nails of injustice,<br>\nThe granite Son shines from beneath the stone.<br></p>\n<p>Spires reach toward the heavens<br>\nLike a distress beacon, casting lamentations<br>\nDestined to fall upon deaf ears.<br>\nDestined to drift upward into the frigid void.<br></p>\n<p>Truth, hollow as the sanctuary halls,<br>\nTruth, hallowed as the art of sacrifice;<br>\nNothing good comes without sacrifice.<br>\nNothing worthwhile comes without a paid price.<br></p>\n<p>Forevermore, there will be another block to be laid,<br>\nAnother brick to be placed, another request to be made,<br>\nAnother flourish to be carved, another story to be told,<br>\nAnother light to be shone, and another stone to be rolled.<br></p>\n</em>\n</div>\nby <strong>Elgin Davis</strong>\n</div>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!

In the episode <a href=\"https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast-episode/198-design-your-happiness-project/\">Design Your Own \"Happiness Project\"</a>, Rubin presents a novel and exciting idea of creating some sort of project that \"helps you identify the resolutions that will bring more happiness to your life -- and then helps you keep those resolutions\". In last week's playbook edition, we talked briefly about filling the blank spaces in your life with the things you love to do and the people you love to do those things with. This idea is a part of the active rest we need to remain emotionally and mentally stable, physically healthy, spiritually attuned, and in a generally more positive and uplifting state of mind.

Have you ever been around someone who is cranky or grumpy (or both) when they don't get enough sleep? Odds are if you've ever seen crying babies, you've seen someone like this. It's not their fault necessarily, but one thing that we should understand is the limits posed on our mental and emotional functionalities when our brain hasn't had enough time to recover from the last stretch of activity. Personally speaking, I can usually feel how little control I have over my emotions and reactions when I am operating in a sleep-deprived, mentally exhausted state. Beyond learning to better control your emotions in this exhausted state, one of the best things you can do here is learn to avoid being in that state altogether.</p>\n<p>We live in an always-on, always-active society, and it can seem counterintuitive and even counterproductive to schedule some downtime for yourself, but active rest is one of the most important things we can do to keep our spaces (mental, emotional, spiritual, physical) healthy. Check out <a href=\"https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/why-its-important-schedule-more-downtime-your-brain\">this article from shape.com</a> to learn more of the science behind this idea and to learn some concrete steps for keeping your mental health in top form.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/why-its-important-schedule-more-downtime-your-brain'>Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6b28c040-3dcc-40c1-a92c-375b4fa4bd2c.png' alt='MopBoy in action in game demo'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        MopBoy in action\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a simple, calm piece from Winter Hearth Studios called \"Quietude\". This week, in the spirit of rest, we're going to relax a bit and check out the brand new desktop game experience from Winter Hearth community members <a href=\"https://cakezero.itch.io/\">CakeZero</a> called \"MopBoy\". </p>\n<p>According to CakeZero, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Mop Boy is a top down rpg/ side-scrolling platformer hybrid about a family owned restaurant and the boy who mops its floors. The game centers around Mop Boy, a kid whose family owns and lives above a pizza restaurant, Doughboys (based on our team member’s family-owned restaurant of the same name). While the other members of the Boy family have normal restaurant jobs (running deliveries, cooking, taking orders), he’s left battling the grease lingering from the daily grind. Upstairs, Mop unwinds and replenishes lost health while bonding with his family.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is sure to be a charming and exciting game, and I can't wait to play the Mac release when it comes out -- great work CakeZero!

Many of you have indicated that you would like to learn more about emotional intelligence, so the content of this weekly publication going forward is going to focus more on engaging you with content in this area. Social and emotional learning is something that is often overlooked, especially in the development stages of youth. In light of the increasing publicity and awareness of issues pertaining to mental health around the world, educators are beginning to recognize how important it is to deliberately teach children and adults explicitly how to control, develop, and take ownership of their emotions and social interactions. This is the basis of Social and Emotional Learning.</p>\n<p>Social and Emotional Learning is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. In other words: It’s how students learn the skills of emotional intelligence.\"</em> <strong>(<a href=\"https://www.6seconds.org/education/social-emotional-learning/\">6 Seconds, The Emotional Intelligence Network</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can tell, it's a pretty massive topic, but as we work through its elements and nuances in this and future playbook editions, you'll notice a stark contrast in the way you see the world (a positive one, of course). Humans, their actions, their feelings, and their thoughts will begin to make more sense to you. You'll be able to understand why certain things make you feel a certain way and, perhaps more importantly, you'll be equipped with the tools to address and conquer those things that may currently have the ability to hold you back from living your best life. This ability to control the self and effectively manage social interactions is <strong>true power</strong>, and if you keep up with the Epic Life Playbook, that power will soon be yours.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591870752/john-koenig-what-if-there-were-a-word-for-every-emotion-in-the-world'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0185a1b2-3704-49f3-90cd-177f8224db19.jpg' alt='TED npr logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week, we're going to check out a podcast episode called \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/591870448/decoding-our-emotions?showDate=2018-03-09\">Decoding Our Emotions</a>\" from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/\">TED Radio Hour</a>. The episode features four different sets of ideas from four different speakers, and the first speaker is none other than John Koening. In his talk \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591870752/john-koenig-what-if-there-were-a-word-for-every-emotion-in-the-world\">What If There Were A Word For Every Emotion In The World?</a>\", he opens our minds briefly to the idea that there is a certain power in being able to precisely express a feeling. He notes how there is a sense of relief that comes over you when you are able to understand and communicate your emotions accurately and effectively, both to yourself and to others (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790\">check out tip number 5 in this article for more insights about the language of emotion</a>).</p>\n<p>In case you haven't heard of him yet, Koenig is the author of \"<a href=\"http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/\">The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</a>\", a collection of words that he himself has created to identify precise emotions that people may feel but don't currently have the vocabulary to fully express. His ideas are pretty remarkable, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591870752/john-koenig-what-if-there-were-a-word-for-every-emotion-in-the-world\">in this talk</a> (about 7 minutes long), he highlights some of the major ideas underlying the ability to communicate emotions effectively. For me personally, I actually use some of Koening's words in my daily life and work. For example, \"<a href=\"http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/search/sonder\">sonder</a>\" is the word he created to describe \"the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own\". I used this word as the title to my first poem, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/elgin-sonder-80ec6b716f37\">Sonder</a>, to capture the essence of my ideas about society and how broken it is at the moment.</p>\n<p>The handle for my recently launched artist Instagram account (follow me <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adronite\">@adronite</a>) is inspired by Koenig's word \"<a href=\"http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/search/adronitis\">adronitis</a>)\", which is defined as \"<em>frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone</em>\". I like to skip the small talk and ask the deep, big-picture questions to get to know people on a foundational level, and so his creation of this word allowed me to capture, understand, and validate that sentiment in a way that I can now use to express myself more precisely.</p>\n<p>Check out this quick talk and gain some new insights on communicating your emotions!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591870752/john-koenig-what-if-there-were-a-word-for-every-emotion-in-the-world'>Check out the talk!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591875336/lisa-feldman-barrett-can-we-really-tell-how-other-people-are-feeling'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/77d52e17-6790-4f6c-9689-e6e737b808fa.jpg' alt='Lisa Feldman Barrett Ph.D.'/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, I want to dive into another segment from the same podcast episode as above, but this time tuning in to the talk \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591875336/lisa-feldman-barrett-can-we-really-tell-how-other-people-are-feeling\">Can We Really Tell How People Are Feeling?</a>\" (about 10 minutes) By <a href=\"http://clbb.mgh.harvard.edu/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/\">Lisa Feldman Barrett PhD</a>. Dr.Barrett is a huge player in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry, and she holds a number of esteemed positions at Northeastern University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Barrett’s research focuses on the nature of emotion from both psychological and neuroscience perspectives and takes inspiration from anthropology, philosophy, and linguistics (<a href=\"http://clbb.mgh.harvard.edu/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/\">MGH, CLLB</a>). </p>\n<p>In this talk, Dr. Barrett outlines the idea that when we attempt to understand what others are feeling (a primary component of empathy), we are really just guessing. Sure, we can learn empathy to the point that our guesses are usually right and fairly well-informed, but the point is that we cannot be absolutely certain about what someone else is feeling.

Our perception of someone else's emotions are necessarily colored by our own perspectives of the world and how people and emotions work.

This episode, \"<a href=\"https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2017/6/28/misguided-loyalty?rq=misguide\">Misguided Loyalty</a>\", follows the first-person account of an inmate whose life story has been characterized by hardship, tragedy, and detrimental life decisions from his youth. </p>\n<p>It's easy (and very common) to write off inmates as \"terrible people\", and many people decide to do just that, but this episode gives us reason to believe otherwise. Tommy Shakur Ross eloquently recounts his life's story from a very profound point of view, giving us a chance to shift our perspective on how we see inmates, \"gangsters\", and kids who make poor decisions as a result of experienced events that may have been outside of their control.</p>\n<p>His story illuminates the fact that although people may do some pretty terrible things, we are all still human. It shows us how powerfully the experiences we've had, as well as our reactions to those experiences, shape us into the people that we are at any given moment. When you listen to the episode, imagine you are Tommy as he tells you the details of his life. Understanding is the basis of empathy, so where many may jump to judgement, seek instead to understand life through his eyes.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2017/6/28/misguided-loyalty?rq=misguide'>Check out the podcast!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gFLCKEQvU&t=1277s'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/a216b145-2887-40dc-9437-e5b06612da02.jpg' alt=\"Person patting another person's shoulder\"/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>This week's Level Up section is all about building empathy and how to use it to refine your perspective. Bestselling author <a href=\"https://www.danpink.com/\">Daniel H. Pink</a> sums up the concept beautifully:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Empathy is about standing in someone else's shoes, feeling with his or her heart, seeing with his or her eyes. Not only is empathy hard to outsource and automate, but it makes the world a better place.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the same vein, professor <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/healthsciences/about/staff/theresa-wiseman.page\">Theresa Wiseman</a> breaks down empathy into 4 attributes (slightly different from the <a href=\"/newsletters/volume-1/cluttered-space/\">methodology of Daniel Goleman</a>, which we saw a few weeks ago):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The ability to see the world as others see it</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to be non-judgmental</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to understand another person's feelings</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to communicate the understanding of that person's feelings</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given these four attributes of empathy, how might we use them to pursue a better life perspective as it pertains to social interactions? Here's a list of 8 tips I keep in mind to build my empathy skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make no assumptions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Make \"benefit of the doubt\" the default</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Seek to understand before you label, judge, or condemn</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Ask \"why\" even when you think you know the answer</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Learn the lingo of emotional description</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Replace negative adjectives you use to describe someone with the word \"human\"</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Be honest with yourself and others</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Remember that a person's behavior is heavily impacted by events that have happened to them in the past</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out this article I wrote for a closer look at these 8 tips!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'>Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"671\"- a pensive poem that explores a very significant period of hardship in my life. <u>This week's piece is our first community artist feature</u> 🥳 The poem is written by E.

There is so much passion and energy in this community, and at the heart of it all is our shared desire to learn, grow, and live out our best possible lives.</p>\n<p>Following last week's digest on <a href=\"/newsletters/volume-1/letting-go\">Letting Go</a>, the theme of this week's content is The Battle for Your Attention. Some of you may be familiar with the term \"attention capital\" or the idea of an \"attention economy\". The basic premise of these ideas is that in today's society, there are many things vying intensely for your attention - whether it be family, Netflix, Instagram, Snapchat, email, blogs, Youtube, your pet hamster -- you get the point. Your attention is valuable to businesses, because the more time you spend interacting with their products (think Facebook, Instagram, Google, Netflix), the more data they collect on you and your habits, and this data is used to make a greater profit.</p>\n<p>Think about how easy Facebook and Instagram have made it to scroll for hours on their platforms, searching for the sparks of excitement or interesting content. Or you can consider Youtube's autoplay feature, intelligently trained on your viewing habits and designed to keep you on the platform by serving you an even more relevant and engaging video than the one you just finished watching. Or for those who use Snapchat, the streaks feature which give you and a friend a shared, increasingly \"valuable\" trophy for the number of days you open their app and send a message to each other. And we can't leave out Netflix's autoplay and seemingly needy \"Are you still there?\" features that keep you glued to the screen for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Given that we have a finite amount of time in this life, each moment we have is valuable. We have come to know this idea well enough and it has become fairly trite, but what this week's journal seeks to explore is the concrete ways in which we are losing our attention to things that we don't necessarily value, and how to practically shift our attention from those less-valuable things to the things that we find to be more valuable and worth investing our time in.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://hurryslowly.co/028-jonathan-fields/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/304ff7f0-0153-4918-806a-cc4802cc4607.png' alt='Hurry Slowly logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>For this week's Listen section, I tuned in again to the podcast Hurry Slowly, which actually has two great episodes on the subject of attention: \"<a href=\"https://hurryslowly.co/028-jonathan-fields/\">Attention Is Life</a>\" with <a href=\"http://www.jonathanfields.com/about/\">Jonathan Fields</a>, and \"<a href=\"https://hurryslowly.co/003-craig-mod/\">I Want My Attention Back!</a>\" with <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/about/\">Craig Mod</a>. I'll briefly talk about the former episode here and we'll get into some practical steps you can take to win the battle for your attention, but be sure to check out the full interviews when you have time this week for an even deeper understanding. </p>\n<p>One of the crucial insights that Fields leads with in the episode \"Attention Is Life\" is the following idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Wherever your attention lands, that is, for that window of time, your life... So if your attention is on something that is meaningless- without purpose to you- then your life, for that window of time, is being devoted to something which is without meaning - without purpose.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He unravels the notion that if we fill up our finite amount of time in this life with things that do not hold meaning for us, we cannot expect to live a meaningful life. Given all of the things that our attention is being directed to (i.e. the platforms mentioned in the intro), it has become very difficult to realize when our attention is being held by something we don't really value and, even further, it has become difficult to realize that we are being distracted from the lives that we may really want for ourselves.</p>\n<p>I'd be interested in a social experiment where those platforms built around scrolling, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, track the actual distance that we each scroll each day, week, month, and over the courses of our lives. Might you be scrolling miles, marathons, or even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon\">ultras</a>? <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01\">According to MarketWatch</a> in late 2018, \"American adults spend more than 11 hours per day watching, reading, listening to or simply interacting with media.\" That's more than half of the hours we are awake per day.</p>\n<p>Fields' message boils down to constantly asking ourselves the following very important questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>What am I doing right now?</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>What am I trying to accomplish by doing it?</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Why am I doing it right now?</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every time you pick up your mobile phone, do you have a goal? Is there something you are trying to accomplish? Why do you pick it up? These technologies are meant to be a tool that helps us make our daily lives easier to manage, more efficient, and more enjoyable, but if you find that the tool is controlling your life more so than you are benefitting from its use, it might be time to rethink the situation. I often get bored with what I'm doing, and <u>so I pick up my phone with no clear intent</u>. 45 minutes to an hour later, I'm not quite sure what just happened, but what I am certain of is the fact that I just wasted 45 minutes of my life, probably scrolling some platform to see something I wasn't even interested in seeing in the first place.</p>\n<p>The concept of \"<em>mindfulness</em>\" is explored in the episode, and leads us to the understanding that if we aren't being intentionally mindful about what we are doing with our time and attention, then the actions we are taking are probably mindless. For example, if I get a notification on my phone (which I don't allow anymore) and the screen lights up, I'll look at the phone, probably unlock it, and go directly to the notification within the span of probably one second -- without even thinking about it. In that situation I'm forced to ask myself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>\"Was that notification important enough to take me out of the present moment?\"</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>\"Why did I need to check the notification right away?\"</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>\"Was this even something that I needed to be notified about?\"</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These and other questions are things that you have to ask yourself if you want to win the battle for your attention and craft a more meaningful life. Above all, when asking yourself these questions, make sure to be honest with yourself and not to try to rationalize your behavior. Improvement starts with an honest assessment of who you are now and an attainable idea of who you want to be. </p>\n<br>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>Try this challenge this week: </p>\n<p>Every time you find yourself using a device, ask yourself what you are currently doing, what you are trying to accomplish by doing it, and why it needs to be done at that exact moment. When the notification pings, when the group messages are drooling down your lock screen, or when you are scrolling down a social platform, ask yourself those questions and mentally note the answers. Do the answers you come up with fall in line with who you want to be? If not, keep performing this awareness-building activity until you are able to break the habits.</p>\n <br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://hurryslowly.co/028-jonathan-fields/'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7562a1b3-fe3f-4a93-835a-9d349ccb5f3d.png' alt='TED logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>For this week's Learn section, I watched a really insightful and thought-provoking TED Talk from <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/tristan_harris\">Tristan Harris</a>, who has been called \"the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience\" by The Atlantic magazine. Harris is the founder of the Center for Humane Technology, a former Design Ethicist at Google, and was named one of the \"25 People Shaping the World\" in 2017 by Rolling Stone magazine.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention?utm_campaign=tedspread&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_source=tedcomshare\">this talk</a>, Harris shares how he has seen the major tech and media companies use psychological tactics to influence our thoughts and behaviors, to persuade us to spend our lives on these platforms, and, of course, to reap a large profit. He discusses the problems we face in a technology-driven society, as well as the precise changes that need to be made to solve those problems.</p>\n<p>One major point he notes is that we as humans must acknowledge that we are able to be persuaded. The more that we understand about how our own minds work, the better we can protect ourselves from the people who might try to use our minds against us.</p>\n<p>So what can you do to protect yourself from being controlled?

Newport is a theoretical computer science professor at Georgetown University, and has been featured on many TED Talks and podcasts, speaking on the awareness of the effects of social media on our communities, the idea of \"<a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\">Deep Work</a>\" (which he has also written a book about), and, more broadly, the intersection between technology and society.</p>\n<p>The concept of \"Deep Work\", as defined by Newport, is \"t<strong>he ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task</strong>\". This task could be writing an article, doing a homework assignment, planning an event, or any other thing that you find yourself needing to do at your job or in your daily life. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gFLCKEQvU\">this interview</a> on Deep Work, he gives 4 rules to help us sharpen our focus and regain our attention, and I've added some concrete ways by which we can maximize the benefit of these rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work Deeply</strong> - Working intentionally in a state of focus allows us to reap great benefits. Tactics that can help you reach this state of focus include:</li>\n<li><strong>Disabling push notifications</strong> - If any kind of ping, pop, sparkle or buzz takes you out of your focus zone, disable it. Whether this means putting your devices into airplane mode or Do Not Disturb mode for a period of time or turning off notifications altogether, choose a way that works best for you to protect your focus.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule your focus time</strong> - Be intentional about the time you have set aside to work deeply on a task. Whether you work for 20 minutes or for 3 hours, make sure that your chosen time block is solid and that nothing (except emergencies, of course) is able to disrupt the time you have set to work.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule the time you check notifications</strong> - Most notifications do not need to be addressed in real time, and even further, notifications keep us on-the-clock 24/7, which is detrimental to living an intentional life. Schedule a few small time slots each day to go through all of your notifications, rather than addressing each of them as they come and switching context hundreds of times per day (a situation that leaves something called \"attention residue\", which Newport talks about as well in the interview). For example, I have set aside 30 minutes starting at 8:30am and 8:30pm for me to go through all of my emails and Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn notifications. Outside of those times, I do not check these platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace Boredom</strong> - In order to attain a consistent level of focus, you need to train your brain to do so. Just as an artist needs to practice consistently to master their craft, you too must practice focus if you want to gain your attention back. Silence or lack of a pressing task does not necessitate picking up a device and killing time. Instead, find something you value (for me, it's drawing, writing poetry, and writing this digest) and do that thing in that space. Fill the free spaces in your life with the things you love most.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quit Social Media</strong> - This will be a tough sell for the foreseeable future, even for me. Newport insists this not as an attack on social media, but rather as a suggestion for us to be more thoughtful about the tools that we use, to know why we use them, and to select a small number of tools that give us each the most value. Ways that may help us figure out which tools to use include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Task-oriented approach</strong> - What are you looking to accomplish? For example, are you trying to stay up-to-date on your friends' lives? Text messaging or calling is much more effective, personal, and intentional than hoping to see their recent updates during a scrolling session. Do you want your friends and acquaintances to hear about and see what you're up to? Social media is really good for this. However, be intentional about which features you use. If your goal is sharing your updates, you probably will not need to spend time scrolling through hundreds of other updates or hanging out on \"explore\" pages. **If the goal is to avoid an awkward social encounter (like when we get in an elevator with a stranger and nobody says anything), see the content from <a href=\"/newsletters/volume-1/maximixing-potential\">digest #2</a> on introductions!</li>\n<li><strong>Research the environments and impacts of the technology you use</strong> - Be conscious of the implicit biases and influences of various platforms and systems and how they can affect you. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads\">Check out this awesome TED Talk for more insight on the topic</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask yourself awareness-building questions</strong> - Check out the Challenge in the Listen section for ways to build your awareness and to help you figure out which tools you actually need to accomplish your goals.</li>\n<li><strong>\"Drain the shallows\"</strong> - The idea of this rule is to \"reduce the amount of shallow work in your working tasks\", meaning focus on the important tasks when you are in your focused state, rather than dealing with all of the smaller, less important tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4gFLCKEQvU&t=1277s'>Check out the video!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/the-simple-sound-2045d4be0712\">The Simple Sound</a>\", and this week's piece is a poem entitled <em>\"671\"</em>. This piece is pretty personal to me, so I hope you'll give it a read. It explores one of the toughest periods of my life that I had never really tried to put words to until now, and maybe you can relate to it on some level. \"What is 671?\" you might ask. Well, there's one sure way to find out... </p>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 8% 0;\">\n<div style=\"margin: 0 12%; text-align: left\">\n<h1>671</h1>\n<p>Slumped anxiously against the ivory windowsill, he warily peered out into today’s storm — yesterday’s storm — tomorrow’s storm, careful not to see too much — Not to see too much. Not to think too much. Not to say too much. Not to feel too much.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>Save me.</p></em></div>\n<p>His shallow breaths danced sheepishly on the thick window pane, tapping to the cadence of a pain long forgotten, tapping to the rhythm of distress. \nHis distressed jeans began to cut off circulation as he receded farther into the depths of himself, falling nowhere fast, falling to the feet of Darkness, who greeted his advance and gave him a quick, comforting kiss on the cheek.</p>\n<p>Outside in the gripping clutches of the now raging storm, his friend of 3 years, Otis, walked by cheerfully and upright. Unphased, unaffected, unperturbed.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>I know I know who that was.</p></em></div>\n<p>Jolted back to the inner reaches of his mind, shrouded with a mist of delusion, he sat up straight, eyes fixed steadily, intently on the world beyond the window.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>What was his name?</p></em></div>\n<p>The fallen brown leaves graced the fallow, fertile ground outside his sanctuary, sauntering loftily between the exploding thunder of the tempest.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>Six-hundred and seventy days.</p></em></div>\n<p>Peals of anger, rage boomed from above, seamlessly rending the heavens and the earth apart. The rumblings reverberated in his ears like drumfire, blasting the all-too-familiar anthem of chaos, as it had for the last six-hundred and seventy days. He shuddered, blood rushing through his body like glaciers tearing across the open sea.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>Who was that? I, I know I know him.</p></em></div>\n<p>Struggle as it might, the sun will not come out today. No — today will not be that day.</p>\n<p>He reached into the pile of clothes strewn about his bed and pulled out a black shirt that read “More Than a Conqueror”. Resigning to give today another shot, he sniffed the shirt, donned his hope, and marked another tick off on the wall.</p>\n<div class=\"text-right\"><em>Six-hundred and seventy-one.</p></em></div>\n<p>Six-hundred and seventy-one days had now passed since the last concussion. With a lungful of trepidation and eyes dark as death, he exhaled, neatly gathered his things, and set out into the storm once more.</p>\n<p>By <strong>Elgin Davis </strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook!

Many things come to mind when we think of letting go -- from letting go of people from our lives, to letting go of past events, or even letting go of physical items that we struggle to part ways with. The topic of this week's newsletter is releasing the things that are causing you pain or distress in order to grab hold of something that can bring you much more happiness, fulfillment, and contentment.</p>\n<p>If you only check out the content from one of the sections this week, listen to the full podcast from the Listen section -- it may change your life.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour#res686332510'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0185a1b2-3704-49f3-90cd-177f8224db19.jpg' alt='TED npr logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>Listen</p>\n<p>This has been without a doubt the most powerful podcast episode I have listened to so far (out of roughly 100 episodes), and if you take the time to listen to or watch one thing this week, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour#res686332510\">listen to this podcast</a> from NPR's TED Radio Hour entitled \"Forgiveness\".</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning</strong>: The topic of this episode is forgiveness, so understandably some of the stories shared in the episode depict very terrible events that have happened to people in the past, including mass shootings, suicide, issues concerning mental health, and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The episode follows three separate stories, including stories from the mother of one of the perpetrators of the Columbine Shooting in 1999 and a survivor of sexual assault. While these stories do address very heavy emotional subjects, there is so much to be learned from the stories here and I can't encourage you strongly enough to listen to the episode in its entirety.

How many of us have been known to hold on to things \"just in case I need it one day\"? Before I started traveling and living out of two suitcases, I was absolutely that person. I used to be all about keeping all of those big and little things \"just in case\". In both this case and the case where you aren't a constant traveler, holding on to things that no longer serve you can weigh you down not only physically, as in my case, but also spiritually, mentally, and even emotionally.</p>\n<p>In this episode (up to about 18:30... fair warning, it got really weird and I stopped listening after that), Joshua and Ryan talk about their philosophies on what to keep, what to give away, and when it makes sense to choose one option over the other. They have some really good points regarding what it looks like to let go of the things that don't hold much value for you, and what it looks like to keep only those things that do have value to you. Logically, you must first understand what exactly it is that you value in this world in order to determine which things are worth keeping and which things aren't. We'll cover that in a future episode, but for now, check out some of their insights on letting go of those things that may weigh us down.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDUx-h0TFWU&feature=youtu.be'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0d749718-ff7b-4ffb-a29f-75c904f7a41f.jpeg' alt='Spotify'/>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>This week's Level Up section comes from something I've experienced recently in my own life. In terms of music subscription services, I'm an avid Spotify listener. I love listening to music, as most people do, and I'm a fan of the jazz, hip hop, R&#x26;B, and singer/songwriter genres.</p>\n<p>Hip hop is usually my go-to genre when I want to dance or get pumped up, but as many of us have noticed, the lyrics in most of these songs are often obscene, portray somewhat twisted values and ideals, and glamorize lifestyles that can actually be very harmful to the self and to others. Music has long been a method of communicating ideas, and whether we recognize it or not, the music we listen to has a profound effect on the way we think, feel, and act.\n(For more insights on the effects of music, <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/124/5/1488\">check out this piece by the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>)</p>\n<p>Spotify, along with some of the other music subscription services, recently rolled out a feature that allows users to toggle whether or not they want songs labeled \"explicit\" to be able to play as they are listening to music. While some songs containing explicit content may elude being marked as \"explicit\", many of the songs are labeled pretty accurately. </p>\n<p>I tried this feature for the first time when I went on my 3-week mission trip to South Africa up until about a week after I had returned to the states. After that point, I felt like I was ready to get back to listening to all of the music I had been listening to before the trip, so I turned off the explicit content filter. I played one of the Spotify hip hop playlists, and I remember very vividly the very acute, dissonant sensation that occurred in my brain over the course of a few songs.</p>\n<p>I'm not usually the type of person to listen to song lyrics, as I tend to appreciate the music behind the lyrics more so than the lyrics themselves, but upon being re-introduced to all of these messages, I could finally see with a refreshed perspective how the messages in certain music has been and can be so harmful not only for impressionable youth, but also really for anybody. After a few songs, I couldn't stand to listen to the messages any longer. Having realized how harmful they can be to the way we think and act as well as the ideas that they are really communicating, I turned the filter back on indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Keeping in line with the theme of \"letting go\", I realized from this experience that music that communicates these negative ideas is something that doesn't add value to (and maybe even detracts value from) my own personal experience in life, and so I've decided to let it go. This is not to diminish the hip hop genre as a whole, because there are still many great songs in the genre that don't share the same ideas as those in the explicit category. More generally, the realization that I came to recently is that if something does not serve you in a positive way, let it go. In letting go of that music, I was prompted to find new, interesting artists and genres that I might not have explored otherwise, and it has been great so far.</p>\n<p>Take a close look this week and see if there is anything you are holding on to that might be keeping you back from realizing a deeper, more intentional, and more meaningful experience in your life.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/from-the-heart-7a3f1e5f9784\">From the Heart</a>\", and this week's piece is a poem entitled \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/the-simple-sound-2045d4be0712\">The Simple Sound</a>\".

Briefly mentioned above is the idea of your external physical space - the space around you at any given moment. There's a ton of information on the internet about getting organized externally, but when we start to consider a person's internal space as opposed to their external space, that's where things start to get a bit more interesting.</p>\n<p>What do I mean when I speak of a person's internal space? Broadly speaking, some of the main categories of internal space are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Emotional</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Mental</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Spiritual</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ideas present us with the question, \"<em>How can we expect to truly 'de-clutter our space' if we aren't aware that parts of the space exist?</em>\" It's like the idea of a person trying to clean an entire house, but that person is only aware that one room in the house exists. They have no working knowledge of the existence of the other rooms -- or the states that those rooms might be in -- so how could that person possibly clean the entire house? We'll explore these questions and more in this week's newsletter. </p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://castbox.fm/vb/115745172'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bf332dd-ba71-422b-b1fa-dd4d7631b6a9.jpg' alt='Oprah SuperSoul logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://supersoul.tv/\">SuperSoul</a> is an amazingly intellectual podcast hosted by none other than the inspiring, insightful, and emotionally intelligent Oprah Winfrey. In SuperSoul, as well as in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal (this newsletter ), one of the main goals is to discover and connect to the deeper meaning of the world around us. This week I listened to <a href=\"https://castbox.fm/vb/115745172\">Episode 101</a> of SuperSoul where Oprah interviews <a href=\"http://danielgoleman.info/\">Daniel Goleman</a>, one of the world's leaders in research and understanding of the concept of \"emotional intelligence\" and author of the best-selling, \"paradigm-shattering\" (as noted by the Harvard Business Review) book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-10th-Anniversary-Matter/dp/055380491X/\">Emotional Intelligence</a>. There is so much eye-opening discussion in this podcast episode, so make sure you check it out!</p>\n<p>One of the most notable things we have learned from Dr. Goleman is the depth and impact of the realm of emotional intelligence. Goleman describes <strong>emotional intelligence</strong> as the way in which we handle ourselves and our relationships, and he breaks it down in terms of <strong>4 domains</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7m9eNoB3NU\">in this video</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> - knowing what we're feeling and why we're feeling that way</li>\n<li><strong>Self-management</strong> - handling your distressing emotions in an effective way and tuning in to them when necessary to learn what we must</li>\n<li><strong>Empathy</strong> - knowing and understanding what someone else is feeling</li>\n<li><strong>Social skills</strong> - the ability to use the other three domains to effectively manage and nurture strong, healthy relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the episode, Goleman and Oprah also go in depth with the concept of empathy and its different facets. In total, Goleman notes <strong>3 major types of empathy</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Cognitive empathy</em></strong> - Understanding how another person sees the world and what their perspective is; Understanding what mental models and language another person uses to perceive and communicate</li>\n<li><strong><em>Emotional empathy</em></strong> - Recognition of the other's emotional state</li>\n<li><strong><em>Empathic concern</em></strong> - Beyond recognition and understanding of another person's mental and emotional state, empathic concern is feeling the urge to assist that person if they are in a state of distress (noted by Goleman in the episode as the \"basis for compassion\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The episode also hits on the relatedness of these three internal spaces- the emotional, the mental, and the spiritual. In terms of spirituality, Dr. Goleman says that in order to personally understand this space, we have to take the domains of emotional intelligence \"up a notch\", citing self-awareness as the trait that we need to develop in order to help us <strong>tune into the state of our spirit and effectively process our experiences</strong> (which, as he notes, can be achieved through deep reflection, journaling, and meditation, among other methods). Oprah adds that it is crucially important that we are <strong>intentional in taking the time to practice these self-awareness activities</strong> if we want to have a greater, healthier, and more meaningful experience in life.</p>\n<p>So how do these ideas help us \"de-clutter our space\"? In continuing with the metaphor of the person attempting to clean the house while unaware of the other rooms in the house, the first thing we need to do is realize that the other spaces exist. We need to realize and internalize these ideas in emotional intelligence and dig a little deeper to find out what we need to do to improve our own emotional intelligence. This episode is great for that, because the discussion goes into much greater depth than most articles or Google searches.</p>\n<p> Throughout the conversation, they unearth many insights about the self and how we can \"de-clutter\" our mind, heart, and soul - the mental, emotional, and spiritual spaces that we ought to pay more attention to on a daily basis. At the core, these spaces are all intrinsically linked, and if one of these spaces is \"cluttered\", that could bode pretty poorly for the rest of them, and especially for an individual's composite health.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/vb/115745172'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_the_case_for_emotional_hygiene'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5dfa86fd-c94e-4eab-916a-79c6a251d370.jpg' alt='Guy Winch at TED'>\n    </a>\n    <p>Guy Winch: Why we all need to practice emotional first aid</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>When we think of health, even composite health, what more commonly comes to mind may be the idea of physical health across the various systems of the body. If someone were to ask me, \"Are you healthy?\" I'd probably think for a moment about the last time I went to the doctor, the last time I had a cold, or recent aches and pains. I'll be the first to admit that when people talk about health, I'm predisposed, perhaps drawing from my interactions with society, to think of physical health as \"overall health\".</p>\n<p>Thinking back to the metaphor of cleaning a house (you'll feel like you know everything about this house by the end of this newsletter!), I briefly mentioned that someone attempting to clean a house without working knowledge of the existence of the other rooms in the house would reasonably have no idea of the states that those rooms are in. Once the person becomes aware of those rooms, they can gain access to them. Once they can access the rooms, they can finally assess the state of these rooms and begin to clean them up, working towards eventually cleaning the whole house. </p>\n<p>In the same line of thought, once we become aware of those internal spaces - the emotional, mental, and spiritual - we can access them, assess their respective states, and finally begin to work toward cleaning them up. We can think of the state of each of our internal spaces as that space's respective health. Emotional, mental, and spiritual health (as well as physical health, of course) are all parts of our composite health that must be considered if we are truly looking to become healthier and happier, and to improve our experience in life.</p>\n<p>In this TED Talk, <a href=\"http://www.guywinch.com/\">Guy Winch</a>, a licensed psychologist, advocate for psychological health, and author of the book <a href=\"http://geni.us/FBGb\">Emotional First Aid: Healing Rejection, Guilt, Failure, and Other Everyday Hurts</a>, unravels the concept of \"emotional hygiene\". He explores the ways in which we can improve our methods for addressing the emotions that we all experience as human beings. The concept of emotional hygiene, (similar to the idea of dental hygiene, which most of us don't go a day without addressing), is intrinsically linked to a person's mental health, and he gives a number of great points on how we can practically \"de-clutter\" both our emotional and mental spaces.

Her book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Language-Emotional-Intelligence-Essential-Relationships/dp/0071544550\">The Language of Emotional Intelligence</a>\" is one of those books that has changed my life forever. I read it for the first time in 2018, and its insights introduced me to many powerful ideas, giving me a new perspective on how I perceive the world around me and how I can better lead my own life (missed the segment on the power of introductions? <a href=\"/newsletters/volume-1/maximizing-potential\">Check it out here in last week's newsletter</a>).</p>\n<p>Conflict is something that we as humans all encounter -- whether it be conflict with another person or group of people, conflict with an idea or concept, conflict with a situation, internal conflict, etc. One of the most game-changing statements in the book comes when Dr. Segal states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Ironically, conflict offers us one of the best opportunities for improving relationships. When conflict ends in resolution, it stimulates brain growth and fosters safety and trust.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Take a moment to let that sink in.</p>\n<p>It takes fairly deliberate effort to successfully resolve a conflict, but when we take a closer look, each conflict really offers us an opportunity to more deeply understand the other person, group, idea, or whatever else we may be conflicted with. Throughout the rest of the chapter, Dr. Segal continues to explore the concept of conflict and how we each develop different relationships with it based heavily on the situations that we've encountered in our respective lives. Moving into the practical application, she notes the importance of the skill of \"taking conflict in stride and resolving differences in ways that build trust and confidence\". So how does this work?</p>\n<p>In essence, there are <strong>4 emotionally-intelligent skills</strong> that enable a person to take conflict in stride and resolve differences in ways that build trust and confidence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The ability to quickly reduce one's own stress levels</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to experience and manage one's strong emotions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to recognize and practice nonverbal communication</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The ability to meet challenges with a sense of humor</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're able to learn these skills (which you totally are), you will in turn have the power to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay focused in the present</strong>, untainted by fear or pain from your past</li>\n<li><strong>Choose your arguments</strong>, recognizing what is worth arguing about and what is not</li>\n<li><strong>Forgive others</strong>, realizing that \"resolution lies in releasing the urge to punish, which can never compensate for our losses and only adds to our injury by further depleting and draining our lives\"</li>\n<li><strong>End conflicts that can't be resolved</strong>, understanding when it is time to disengage from a conflict</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is such a great and applicable book, full of instructional activities and insights that you can use to concretely develop your emotional intelligence. The content extracted from the book here, as well as the rest of the content in Dr. Segal's book, will go a very long way in helping you finally make those rooms spotless (remember the cluttered mental and emotional spaces in the house metaphor?), and keep them that way for a long time to come.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://www.amazon.com/Language-Emotional-Intelligence-Essential-Relationships/dp/0071544550'>Check out the book!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"To Do or To Be?\" which explores the nuances between the different modes of our existence. This week's piece is a poem entitled \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/from-the-heart-7a3f1e5f9784\">From the Heart</a>\", which highlights the state of a heart or \"soul\" that has a deep story to tell. The owner of this heart has been through quite some hardship during their lifetime, and we as the audience get a brief glimpse into the state and story of this heart. Thinking back to the ideas presented at the beginning of this newsletter, see if you're able to resonate with the story using any of the 3 forms of empathy noted by Daniel Goleman (<strong><em>cognitive empathy</em></strong>, <strong><em>emotional empathy</em></strong>, <strong><em>empathic concern</em></strong>):</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 5%;\">\n<h1>From the Heart</h1>\n<div style=\"margin: 0 18%;\">\n<em>\n<p>Oh sacred, hallowed and hollow Heart,<br>\nTell me, where lies your Truth?<br>\nLong gone are the days of blessed Hope,<br>\nAnd the days of your stainless Youth.</p>\n<p>Where, now do you seek your poise,<br>\nKnowing Folly is not far behind?<br>\nWhat soul is willing to test its resolve<br>\nWith a love so unrefined?</p>\n<p>Dark dreams and devilish desires<br>\nDrip into the chasms of the Heart.<br>\nHow shall we ever find our way out<br>\nFrom beneath the endless sky that thou art?</p>\n<p>I listen as you sing to the moon and the stars<br>\nYour tender, melodic malady.<br>\nSing, oh sacred and graceful Heart,<br>\nYour divine, undying rhapsody.</p>\n</em>\n</div>\n<br>\nby <strong>Elgin Davis</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9\">Click here to follow my poetry work on Medium!</a>\n</div>\n \n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!

This is the second official newsletter, and our community is growing fast! We surpassed the 100 member-milestone in our first week, and we're ready to keep growing as we further explore the human experience in the coming weeks. Thanks so much for joining us, and be sure to share this newsletter with a friend!</p>\n<p>In this week's newsletter, we'll explore the idea of maximizing your life's potential. Many of us have thought at one point or another, \"there are just not enough hours in the day,\" or \"there are so many things that I'd like to do-- I just don't have the time to do it all,\" or something to that effect. This concept is often referred to as the \"poverty of time\" (or \"Time Poverty\" in some instances).</p>\n<p>The concept of a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money-rich,_time-poor\">poverty of time</a>\" (a concept well-explored in <a href=\"https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-defeat-the-tyranny-of-time-poverty-24b310872a8b\">this Medium article</a> by John P. Weiss)  is something that many people face, which makes a lot of sense, given the finite number of days, hours, and minutes that we each have to live our stories. However, the idea of maximizing your life's potential in life goes beyond the notion of \"getting things done\", or simply maximizing productivity. Instead, it seeks to explore the totality of the human experience - from people to ideas, from art to productivity, and, of course, adventure.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.

We're about to take a deep dive, so get ready!</p>\n<p>An introduction, in an abstract sense, is a person's first experience of a subject or thing. We see introductions in novels, articles, newsletters, movies, and advertisements that serve to familiarize an audience with the forthcoming experience. In the world we live in, we are constantly introduced to things. We are introduced not only to lifelong friends, acquaintances, business connections, future spouses, and colleagues, but also to perspectives, ideas, cultures, deeper emotions, experiences, and technology. We each perceive the world from a unique, specific framework of reference, driven by the things we have been introduced to and have experienced. Each introduction that we experience refines those frameworks, allowing us to constantly update and improve the information we use to understand the world around us.</p>\n<p>If you want to maximize your potential experience in life, introduction is necessary. They say that 'travel is the cure for ignorance', but why is that? In the words of Mark Twain, \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” His statement draws from the idea that introducing yourself to different, diverse cultures does indeed refine the framework by which you experience the world.</p>\n<p>Taking that idea one step further, why do we as a society say that reading is valuable for your personal growth? In an age-old quote from the notable children's author Dr. Seuss, “<em>The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.</em>” How does this idea work? Similar to the thoughts of Mark Twain, Dr. Seuss implies here that when we introduce ourselves to new ideas and concepts, as we do in books, we are again able to refine the frameworks of our minds to grow ourselves and craft a fuller, richer experience in life. Another quote that exemplifies this idea comes from George R.R. Martin, which reads, “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one.” We can introduce ourselves to new experiences and ways of life through the stories we read and consume, and we become better individuals because of it. </p>\n<p>And finally, we return to people. People are everything. When you introduce yourself to a person, you are acknowledging their existence, and when you remember their name, you are acknowledging their inherent value as a fellow human being (note, this is not the same as assigning or giving value to a person, but rather merely acknowledging the value that already exists). There is so much nuance that accompanies the introduction of human beings, but for the sake of brevity, we'll consider the most important aspects of human introduction that can help maximize your potential experience- when we introduce, and how we introduce.</p>\n<p>When do we introduce ourselves to a stranger? Is it when we see that they have something to offer us, or when we have something to offer them? Is it when they are talking to a friend of ours? What leads us to introduce ourselves to new people will differ for each of us, and finding the answer to that question will tell you a lot about yourself as a person. If you see a stranger, just any average person, and you decide not to introduce yourself, ask yourself why. You might be surprised by the lengths we as humans may go to in order to rationalize when we do and don't feel like introducing ourselves to someone- someone who has a story just as you do, a story which has the power to change the way that you view the world.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to note on introductions is the way in which we introduce ourselves and each other. Personal introduction is a huge, largely untapped opportunity to show another person (or multiple people) how much you value each of them individually, as well as what you actually value about them. For example: \"Here's my friend Josh,\" versus \"This is my friend Josh, who might just be the coolest person I've ever met.\" Whether or not Josh really is that cool (I'll let you be the judge), in the latter introduction, you're not only showing the other person what you value about your friend Josh, but you're showing Josh himself what you value about him, and the fact that you value him at all (I don't think I know a Josh at the moment, but if you're reading this and your name is Josh, you're probably pretty cool). </p>\n<p>When you introduce yourself to another person, do you ask questions like, \"So... what do you do for a living?\" or do you take it up a notch and say something like, \"What has been the most inspiring thing you've experienced lately?\" One introductory question shows intentionality and genuine interest in getting to know a new person, while the other doesn't show much of anything.</p>\n<p>As you get going this week, be intentional in <u>introducing yourself to new and unfamiliar contexts, ideas, cultures, and people</u>. And who knows, you might find just the adventure you've been looking for.</p>\n<p>(If you'd like to practice the art of the email introduction, feel free to introduce yourself to me at the end of this newsletter!)</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/tim_harford_a_powerful_way_to_unleash_your_natural_creativity'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bc0dfe5-0e20-4613-99bb-1c4d47202a33.png' alt='Tim Harford at TED'/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>This week's Learn section features a talk from <a href=\"http://timharford.com/\">Tim Harford</a>, where he shares how innovators like Einstein, Darwin, Twyla Tharp and Michael Crichton found their inspiration and productivity through cross-training their minds. He introduces ( ) the idea of \"slow-motion multitasking\", effectively re-defining multitasking and the idea of \"doing several things at once\".</p>\n<p>I'll save most of the words for Mr. Harford, but it is important to note that when he refers to \"doing several things at once\", the scope of time he refers to is relatively large, like working on multiple projects over the course of a day, a week, or a month, rather than literally doing multiple things at the same moment. Also, it is worth noting that a \"project\" is not limited to technical tasks like building a website, an app, or a birdhouse, but can include just about anything you want to do, such as learn to play an instrument, learn how to draw, practice social skills, or become more emotionally intelligent.</p>\n<p>This idea of <em>slow-motion multitasking</em> is a major step toward maximizing your potential experience, because it allows us to take on multiple pursuits concurrently, while not giving up anything we are passionate about pursuing. What might it require of us? Patience. While \"Tunnel vision\" may allow us to focus in on a single thing for a duration of time and \"get things done faster\", what happens when we encounter a huge obstacle inside that tunnel?

Belsky opposes this notion in the book, reasoning that, <strong><em>\"The ideas that move industries forward are not the result of tremendous creative insight but rather of masterful stewardship.</em></strong>\"</p>\n<p>With respect to achieving results, what good is it being creative if a person cannot execute the creation process? What good would it serve DaVinci to be an incredibly skilled artist if he could never finish a work of art? What good would it serve Mozart to be an incredibly skilled composer if he could never finish a composition? Belsky presents the formula that Making ideas happen = Ideas + Organization + Communal forces + Leadership capability. For this week's section, we'll focus briefly on his ideas on organization.</p>\n<p>The Behance CEO presents us with the concept of the Action Method: the idea that everything is a project (as we noted above in Tim Harford's Ted Talk). Projects range from taking a class to personal finances, from planning birthday parties to getting in shape, and from building an app to basically anything else you can think of doing. In his notes, he states that every project in life can be reduced into 3 primary components: Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items. Action Steps are the specific, concrete tasks that move the project forward (i.e. send the email, make the phone call, watch the lecture. Note how these are all verb-based statements). Though we have introduced the idea of \"slow-motion multitasking\" in the Learn section, remember that you can only focus on one action step at any given moment, but you can work on action steps across multiple projects within the same larger-scale time frame (i.e. a day, week, or month). References are the project-related documents, notes, sketches, manuals, website links, or discussion that you may want to refer back to at a later point to accomplish your Action Steps. Finally, we have the Backburner Items, which are the things that are not currently actionable but may become actionable at some point in the future. </p>\n<p>What might this look like in practice? For me personally, I usually have no less than 4 \"projects\" going on at the same time (this newsletter being one of them), and this system of organization absolutely works. In terms of tooling, I use the web application Asana to keep my tasks and projects organized and to keep track of the Action Steps and Backburner Items. Among the many great things about Asana are the facts that it is free for individual use, you can actually create \"projects\" within the app that have their own space and sets of tasks, and the main task view splits your action steps into sections based on due date. For References, I use Evernote, because it is also free, it allows you to save your notes in the cloud, and you can even \"clip\" web pages and other online content directly into your Evernote notebooks. Ideally, each project in Asana would correspond with a notebook in Evernote if you were to choose this route for organization. I would say that if you struggle staying organized and making your goals and dreams achievable, this is an easy win to get you back on track to maximizing your potential.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>In this week's Fireside Spotlight, I would like to share a poem I published on Medium back in 2018 called \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/to-do-or-to-be-eb8f1064eafb\">To Do or To Be?</a>\". Most of us have heard of the famous speech from Hamlet, \"To be or not to be,\" wherein he contemplates the relative values of life and death. Inspired by Shakespeare's piece, I chose to wrestle instead with the idea of \"doing\" versus the idea of \"being\":</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding-top: 5%;\">\n<h1>To Do or To Be?</h1>\n<div style=\"margin: 0 18%; text-align: left\">\n<em>\n<p>Whether ’tis nobler to finish the deed,<br>\nWhether ’tis nobler to set the soul free,<br>\nWhether ’tis better to do or to be,<br>\nThe reticent cosmos has yet to decree.</p>\n<p>So we stand, ready to roll up our sleeves,<br>\nTo mark our grand toils and dance with the leaves<br>\n’Til we gain the rewards we are fit to receive<br>\nAnd we subside to dust having been too naive —</p>\n<p>We believed that work could complete a being — <br>\nA being whose work is never done.</p>\n</em>\n</div>\nby <strong>Elgin Davis</strong>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>In my piece, I consider the question: \"<strong><em>At any given moment, is it more valuable to our human experience to be doing something \"productive\", or to be content in our existence, enjoying the wonders of life and \"producing\" memorable experiences?</em></strong>\" When we look to maximize our potential experience in this life, there is truly no one-size-fits-all, prescriptive method that each of us can follow to find the best experience, because each of us is writing a different story. Rather, the key here is to recognize the things that we value, and to pursue those things boldly and intentionally. The question then becomes, \"<em>What do we value?</em>\", which we'll tackle in a future newsletter.</p>\n<p>My favorite line from \"To Do or To Be?\" is the ending, which hints at the idea that as humans, we will never run out of work. We may work day-in and day-out toward whatever goal may be set before us, but do we realize that beyond the achievement of that next goal is <em>always another goal</em>? There is always more to be done, and if we live lives chasing solely after the fruits of our labor, what time do we have to enjoy them?</p>\n<p>As humans, we may proceed as such until we draw our last breath, and when all is said and done, the ultimate question that I ponder in the piece is this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"When my life comes to an end, would I rather have lived a life full of meaning and purposeful experience, or a life that was productive?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is not to say that the two are mutually exclusive, and in fact, they are not. But if I had to choose one, it would certainly be the former. I could not imagine laying on my death bed saying, <em>\"Man, I sure wish I had worked more.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Pursuing a life that balances the two modes patiently and intentionally may be just the thing we are looking for to truly maximize our life's potential. One of my favorite quotes by Ernest Hemingway is, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Every man’s life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What will the details of your story be?</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk It</h3>\n<p>Thanks for joining me again this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal! In the words of Dale Carnegie, \"Knowledge isn't power until it is applied.\" How can you apply the ideas in this newsletter to your life? How can you use it to gain power in living a more epic story?

Her artistic process is driven by her real, raw human experiences, and not derived from any fad or trend. The song \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxgXG-crKo&#x26;feature=youtu.be\">Funeral</a>\" from her 2018 EP <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2018/02/23/charlotte-day-wilson-stone-woman-ep-stream\">Stone Woman</a> is actually the song I played on repeat that allowed me to process and create the Medium-featured piece <a href=\"https://medium.com/winter-hearth-studios/somber-clouds-engulfed-the-formerly-cheerful-sky-swirling-slowly-like-ravenous-birds-of-the-night-6a4e6de49dd2\">A Hope Undone</a> which itself is, as you may have noted, about a funeral. The song opens,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I went to a funeral, so I could feel something. Don't know what I'm living for, if I don't feel nothing.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Take a moment to just imagine the state of mind, the emotions, and the experiences (really stretching those empathy muscles today!) that must have all been present and mixing together for someone to create a work of art, dripping with such raw emotion as this piece.

Glei</a>. Hurry Slowly explores how we can be more productive, creative, and resilient through the simple act of slowing down. In this week's letter I want to highlight the episode entitled \"<a href=\"https://hurryslowly.co/016-fanny-auger/\">Conversation Isn't Always About Talking</a>\", where Glei discusses the key ingredients of a great conversation with <a href=\"http://fannyauger.org/\">Fanny Auger</a>, the founder of the School of Life in Paris and the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/Tr%C3%AAve-bavardages-Fanny-Auger/dp/2366583729\">Trêve de Bavardages</a>.</p>\n<p>There is tons of wisdom in this episode, but the idea that struck me most profoundly was the idea that conversation is an art. It is a craft that, like every other craft or skill, must be developed with time and intentional, diligent practice. This idea really challenged me to reconsider how often my own conversations happen so naturally and without deep thought, and how much of another person's experiences and life story I fail to tap into and learn from by asking surface-level questions or opting to talk about myself instead.</p>\n<p>This is a subtly powerful episode that I definitely recommend and, being about 8 episodes into Hurry Slowly so far, I would 9.5/10 recommend you check it out on whatever podcast app you use to improve yourself in 2019 (I use <a href=\"https://castbox.fm/\">Castbox</a> if you're looking for suggestions).</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5f1b1e09-225e-4503-bd60-c01cf9fbe24c.jpg' alt='Arrows pointing upwards'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Jungwoo Hong on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>This week's level up section comes from a personal observation in redesigning my rhythm of life - my system of existence, if you will. One of the best things that I have found in terms of <u>leveling up my productivity, attention span, and overall control over stress</u>, is <strong>silence</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are many different things that come to mind when we each think of silence. For some people, sitting out by a lake, watching the water slowly make its way from the center to the grassy shore may be their visual representation of silence. For others, silence may be that 40 seconds of staring at the phone after you've just sent a risky \"I like you...\" text to your longtime crush (we've all been there, right?). By silence, I mean a space free of distractions, free of things fighting for our attention, and free to explore life detached from the small, glowing boxes that most of us have grown to depend on.</p>\n<p>For the past week, I have silenced my phone's notifications from 9am to 5:15pm every weekday, and my change in focus, attention, stress level, and general mood has been so radically shifted that I can't recommend it enough. Sure, leave on the ringer for calls in case someone needs to reach you, but in most situations, that text message, the notification of that Instagram like, and the Facebook tag can wait. Only in this silence can your mind be truly restored to the quiet, tranquil state where we secretly long to be.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>For this week's Fireside Spotlight, I would like to feature a book I read recently called \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733/ref=sr_1_1/145-6200674-5800037?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1548472266&#x26;sr=8-1&#x26;keywords=art+and+fear\">Art &#x26; Fear - Observations On The Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking</a>\", by David Bayles and Ted Orland. The book explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artist to give up along the way.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/3be88c5f-368b-431a-8ebc-1172e2e256a7.png' alt='Art & Fear Book'/>\n    <br>Image Continuum Press, 2001\n</div>\n<br>\n \nAmong the things that I learned from this book is the idea that we are all artists -- just to varying degrees and with varying levels of effort. We are all born with the capacity to create, though what we choose to do with that capacity may differ greatly from individual to individual. As we saw above, conversation is an art. Listening is an art. Living is an art. And as is the case with all art, mistakes are a necessary part of the development process.\n<p>Those who really succeed are those who practice relentlessly, even when their work is not spectacular, learning and growing more competent with each engagement until they develop a command of that skill. They are not afraid to make mistakes and are likely much less self-conscious about these mistakes than others, and given a supportive and nurturing environment (or an iron will and unbreakable determination), \"the sky's the limit\" is even too small to describe their potential.</p>\n<p>They live in a growth mindset, understanding that any skill can be learned, and that the perceived advantages of innate talent can always be overcome by diligent effort and focused, intentional learning. Overall, the ideas presented in this book teach us precisely the mindset that we need to truly Live An Epic Story. </p>\n<br>\n<h3>It's A Wrap</h3>\n<p>This week's newsletter has been awesome both to experience for myself and to write just for you! There were so many great things I learned this week that I hope have inspired you to both live and tell your life's epic story. Between learning to feel deeper emotion in our connection with artists, to fighting for our own attention, and from developing listening as a tool for better conversation to leaving fear at the door when you're ready to learn something new, we've just scratched the surface.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Jan 29, 2019","title":"New Year, New Growth","imageUrl":"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5f1b1e09-225e-4503-bd60-c01cf9fbe24c.jpg","imageAltText":"Welcome to Winter Hearth Studios!","featured":false,"newsletterVolume":"1","contentType":"newsletter","tags":["Winter Hearth","Introduction"],"keywords":"Winter Hearth","description":"Volume 1, Issue 1","unsplashBadgeInfo":{"artistName":"","artistUrl":""},"author":{"name":"Elgin Davis","role":"Main Content Writer","summary":"Elgin Davis is the creator of Winter Hearth Studios.
