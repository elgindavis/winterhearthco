**_“Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”_** These have been the inalienable rights of the American people (rather,
some American people...) for hundreds of years. The “pursuit of happiness” has always stood out to me as being an
interesting addition to this list, positing happiness as some sort of right to be protected, or even a goal worth
devoting one’s life toward pursuing.

Skipping ahead to the present, when I hear people talk about their life's goals, they often talk
about how much they just want to “be happy”. I’ll admit, for me it’s much better to hear this as a goal than to hear
about how someone just wants to be rich and/or famous, but there’s still an issue here: **“being happy” is not a real goal.**
I’m not sure how much the founding fathers knew about emotions back in the day, but had they made the same advancements
in psychology and biology in the 1700s as we’ve made to-date in 2020, perhaps they also would have realized that
happiness isn’t a real goal. And perhaps, by the end of this article, you’ll realize the same thing.

<br>

###What are emotions?
  
Before we get to the heart of why I’m not actually an evil dream-crusher, we need to understand a few key things about
emotions, most of which I’ve learned from the brilliant minds of Susan David, Susanne Denham, and Jeanne Segal. First
things first— what are emotions? Essentially, emotions are information. This foundational fact is usually where most
people depart in their understanding of happiness and their goals of “being happy”. Individuals whose life goal is to
“be happy”, though well-intentioned and sincere as they may be, don’t truly understand how emotions work, and if they
don’t understand how the game works, how will they ever win? In short, you can’t be happy. In fact, you
can’t _be_ any emotion, and the way that the average person understands emotions is actually based on this common
misunderstanding. **Emotions are not things you can be — they are things that you feel.** You can never be happy, sad, angry,
afraid, or any other emotion. You can only feel those things, and those feelings give you information that you can use
to guide your decisions.

<br>

###Being vs. Feeling
Beyond the semantic lesson, this idea of _being vs. feeling_ emotions shows us that emotions aren’t in control of our
lives, though they can help us figure things out. Many of us live our lives as if the emotions are the goal (specifically
the positive ones). This is a confusing way to live for several reasons. For example, if your goal is to “be/feel happy”,
how do you get there? How do you sustain that feeling? How do you avoid the other less desirable feelings? You should
also understand that emotions are temporary, just like any other experience. This means that anything you do to elicit a
certain emotion would have to be repeated to continually achieve the same effect.

If I were to look at you in the eyeballs and say that my goal in life is to feel frustrated, what might you say? You might start by
telling me politely that it is a pretty ridiculous goal (it is), and you’d ask why I would want such a thing. My choice
of goal would hopefully make it clear to you that I don’t understand how emotions work (and really how goal-setting
works, either). A deeper response would be to ask why I think feeling frustrated is even a goal at all. After all, do emotions make sense as goals?
Is information your goal? In turn, if you told me that your goal in life was to be happy, I’d probably first note that you can’t be an emotion, and I’d
follow that up with the question, “Well, what makes you feel happy?” And that is where we find the real heart of this
idea. As I mentioned earlier, emotions are not just feelings, they are also data. **_Emotions are the byproducts of meaningful
events that occur in our lives_**, and they give us information about how we perceive a situation and what we value most in
those moments.

<br>

### Taking the Good with the Bad

For a long time people have gone on characterizing emotions as either _“good”_ or _“bad”_, when really they are neither.
Emotions are information. Important information. Undervalued and routinely misunderstood information. We live in a time
where happiness is the life goal for so many people— people who don’t actually understand what happiness itself is. If
you want to consistently feel happy, the real goal should be to consistently do the
things that make you feel happy. However, I'd argue that it makes more sense to pursue the things you value and seek fulfillment there,
rather than chasing after such a fleeting feeling, but that's just my opinion.

<br>

###Great... so what?
When it comes to emotions, we have to reverse-engineer the process in order to repeat it. If your goal is to reach a state of constant happiness,
**the real goal is creating and maintaining a system in your life that predictably produces those emotions in you.**
That system would also have to protect against the enemies of your happiness, of which there are many. Even so, you
can make great strides in your life with this knowledge alone. That leads us now to the big question:

<br>

> _If pursuing happiness means building a system that consistently produces the feeling of
> happiness (while protecting you from other less desirable
> feelings), is it even possible?_

<br>

An even better question, in my opinion, would be:

<br>

**_Is pursuing a life based around an emotion worth your time?_**

<br>

I’ll give you my own answers to these questions and more in an upcoming article.
