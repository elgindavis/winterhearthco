People who routinely encounter emotionally-disturbing events tend to suffer from compassion fatigue. Think of doctors, nurses, EMTs, firefighters, people who watch the news in 2020, and even police officers. Well, some police officers. Compassion fatigue is a form of burnout caused by constant engagement with heavy emotional situations ([Jennifer R. Day & Ruth A. Anderson, 2011](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2011/408024/)). Imagine for a moment the amount of human pain and death confronted by an emergency room technician in a single month or year. Imagine being a teacher and knowing that a few of your kids leave the classroom each day to face abuse from unstable guardians at home. Imagine constantly encountering viral videos of modern-day lynchings— prejudice-driven murders of people that look just like you. Imagine that. 

Feel the way this pain bears down on the human soul, grinding away at what may have once been a particularly resilient and upbeat spirit. Imagine these unresolved feelings crushing you over the course of a year. Ten years. Twenty years. A lifetime. 

<br/>

Perhaps you don’t have to imagine it.

Perhaps, this is your reality, too.

Last year I learned about compassion fatigue, but as a Black man in this cultural moment, I am experiencing something different. I'm experiencing some form of vicarious, inter-generational trauma that I can't even begin to capture with my words. Every Black person who is hunted, beaten, or killed takes a personal emotional toll on me. It takes a mental toll on me. It takes a psychological toll on me— and believe me, those tolls do add up.

<br/>

I feel the blows of every beating.

I feel the bullet holes of every gunshot. 

I’m running out of air, because if my brothers and sisters can’t breathe, I can’t breathe either. <br/>

Humans can only bend so far before they finally

*Hold my hands as I bleed,* <br/>

*Lift my head up to the sky,* <br/>

*Cry my last tear for me,* <br/>

*For my hope has run dry.* <br/>
