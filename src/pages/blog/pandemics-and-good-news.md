I’ve noticed that during this pandemic, many people are searching relentlessly for the positives, the silver-linings, and literally any good news— anything to avoid more statistics and political finger-pointing. I get that. I actually don’t subscribe to any news or updates myself, so most of the updates I get are from one of my family members. Pandemic aside, one thing that really alarms me in this situation is what this frantic search for positivity reveals about the mental and emotional capacities of most people, myself included— we can’t handle the darkness.

### The Problem With Seeking the "Bright Side"
People operate erratically out of fear, worry, and anxiety because they don’t know how to process those darker, less pleasant emotions (looking at you, TP hoarders). Either they haven’t had many opportunities to sharpen those skills, or they misjudge those opportunities and run from them instead of using them as growth tools. One thing I’ve learned is that our desperate search for the “bright side” isn’t the solution. In fact, as we run away from reality right now to find these safer, happier places for our minds to rest, we continue to promote this behavior in ourselves and others. We also completely miss the opportunity to grow amidst the chaos and mature ourselves emotionally. The worst part in my opinion is that the next time something terrible occurs, we will be just as emotionally ill-equipped to face the situation then as we are now.

### Adversity and Opportunity
Adversity and opportunity really aren’t so different. It’s more a matter of how you choose to perceive and respond to them that makes all the difference. Let me be clear— good news isn't the problem. In fact it's, well, good. The issue lies in the way we are using good news as an escape. This is the best opportunity I’ve seen for the global community to learn how to process, manage, and harness our emotions to move to higher levels of emotional resilience and intelligence. I won’t get into the methods in this post in particular (check out this edition of the Epic Life Playbook for more on building emotional resilience and intelligence), but I just want to show you that you have an option here:

### Bottom Line
You can keep avoiding reality— there's no shame you if you’re at this point right now, it isn't easy— or you can plant yourself firmly, prepare to dig in deep, and start processing those big, hairy emotions. The decision is, and will always be, yours to make.
