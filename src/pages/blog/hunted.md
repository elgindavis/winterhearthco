*Brown, bold, swift as the deer,* <br />
*Moving deftly through dense city streets,* <br />
*Careful in step, in mind, in thought,* <br />
*Lest the hunter should don his white sheets.* <br />

*They tell me that murder is a white man’s sport,* <br />
*Trophies fashioned from halted breath.* <br />
***Sans respect, sans crainte, sans souci, sans cesse***, <br />
*He will die for his right to bring death.* <br />

*How high must the hollers of deep pain rise,* <br />
*How low must sacred blood sink,* <br />
*How long ‘til the cup runneth over and at last* <br />
*You finally take your drink.* <br />

*Armed with blind rage and self-righteousness,* <br />
*The hunter stands ready to attack,* <br />
*He aims his sights and prays to God* <br />
*That the deer never learns to shoot back.* <br />
