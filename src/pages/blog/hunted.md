<br />

_Brown, bold, swift as the deer,_ <br />
_Moving deftly through dense city streets,_ <br />
_Careful in step, in mind, in thought,_ <br />
_Lest the hunter should don his white sheets._ <br />

_They tell me that murder is a white man’s sport,_ <br />
_Trophies fashioned from halted breath._ <br />
**_Sans respect, sans crainte, sans souci, sans cesse_**, <br />
_He will die for his right to bring death._ <br />

_How high must the hollers of deep pain rise,_ <br />
_How low must sacred blood sink,_ <br />
_How long ‘til the cup runneth over and at last_ <br />
_You finally take your drink._ <br />

_Armed with blind rage and self-righteousness,_ <br />
_The hunter stands ready to attack,_ <br />
_He aims his sights and prays to God_ <br />
_That the deer never learns to shoot back._ <br />

<br />
