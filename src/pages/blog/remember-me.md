*Remember me when the riots die down and you go back to photographing your latte.*  <br />

*Remember me when my hashtag falls by the wayside.*  <br />

*Remember me when “No More Names” becomes “One More Name”.*  <br />

*Remember me when your head is so full of slain black names that you can no longer keep them all straight.*  <br />

*Remember me, the person you never knew existed until the stars and stripes took my soul from my black body.*  <br />

*Remember me and my fallen brothers and sisters when someone asks you why “everyone is making this about race”.*  <br />

*Remember me when my mother has no more tears left to cry, and when change starts to feel like a pipe dream.*  <br />

*Remember me, my story, my culture, my death.*  <br />

*Remember me, and the years I never got to live.*  <br />

*If there’s one thing I ask of you, it is to remember me— before I need to be remembered.*  <br />
