<br />

_Remember me when the riots die down and you go back to photographing your latte._ <br />

_Remember me when my hashtag falls by the wayside._ <br />

_Remember me when “No More Names” becomes “One More Name”._ <br />

_Remember me when your head is so full of slain black names that you can no longer keep them all straight._ <br />

_Remember me, the person you never knew existed until the stars and stripes took my soul from my black body._ <br />

_Remember me and my fallen brothers and sisters when someone asks you why “everyone is making this about race”._ <br />

_Remember me when my mother has no more tears left to cry, and when change starts to feel like a pipe dream._ <br />

_Remember me, my story, my culture, my death._ <br />

_Remember me, and the years I never got to live._ <br />

_If there’s one thing I ask of you, it is to remember me— before I need to be remembered._ <br />
