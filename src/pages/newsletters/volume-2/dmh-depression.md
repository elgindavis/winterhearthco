### What's New This Week

Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.

It feels like it has been forever since the last edition! Last weekend I was in Scotland visiting a friend before moving from Düsseldorf to Berlin, and now I'm in Berlin for the next 3 months. 

Next week will be the last edition of Volume 2, Demystifying Mental Health (sad, I know), but your knowledge of mental health is just getting started, as is mine. You've been growing into a beautiful and strong mental-health butterfly over the past few months (yes, a mental-health butterfly) and it's almost time to spread your wings! There are tons of topics to explore as they pertain to mental health, and this was just the start. I hope you've enjoyed this newsletter and learned some things along the way, and I'm so grateful that you have taken part in this journey alongside me and all of the other great people here learning more about mental health. I'll be moving on to some other fun projects I have been working on simultaneously (including a new podcast starting soon!), so I hope to see you there as well.

<br />

### What is Depression?
 
Depression, also known as Major Depressive Disorder, is a mental illness that affects how you feel, think, and manage daily activities. You might recall that for most all of the disorders that we've covered, daily hindrance or disruptions are usually crucial to the diagnosis of these disorders. Symptoms must last for at least 2 weeks to diagnose someone with depression, and these symptoms generally include:
- Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
- Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
- Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
- Loss of energy or increased fatigue
- Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)
- Feeling worthless or guilty
- Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
- Thoughts of death or suicide  

*(American Psychiatric Association, 2019)*


There is also a lot of confusion when it comes to distinguishing depression from grief, because many of the symptoms are similar. One of the biggest differences is that with grief, self-esteem is usually not affected, while a depressed individual may experience increased feelings of worthlessness. Grief is also less consistent in terms of symptoms experienced. For example, if a grieving individual comes across positive memories of the person they are grieving, they may see their mood lift significantly, even if it soon sinks again. There is a major link here though, as the loss of a loved one can indeed lead to depression in an affected individual.

Depression can also be further classified. Here is a list of the most common forms of depression:
- Major Depression - the general form of depression, exhibiting the symptoms listed above,
- Persistent Depression/Dysthymia - depression lasting for two years or more,
- Bipolar Disorder/Manic Depressive Disorder - we covered this one a few weeks ago (check out that edition here),
- Depressive Psychosis - depression including hallucinations and delusions,
- Perinatal Depression - depression that occurs within pregnancy or within a month of childbirth. Postpartum depression is similar, but it can only occur after giving birth, while perinatal depression can occur during the pregnancy itself as well;
- Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder - depression linked to the menstrual cycle,
- Seasonal Depression/Seasonal Affective Disorder - depression related to certain seasons (often fall and winter when it is cold, dark, and the days seem shorter),
- Situational Depression - depression brought about by a certain event or series of events,
- Atypical Depression - symptoms temporarily go away in response to some positive events

### Depression Abstracted
 
> *"The depression monster floats around endlessly, always covering his eyes to hide itself from the outside world. Because of this it always bumps into people or other monsters causing more distress to itself each time.*

> *Its only relief is to wrap its fluid tail around a victim and share its depression with them. The victim is unaware of the monster but will register a heaviness and will develop a state of deep depression. Meanwhile the monster absorbs any positive emotion from its host until it has had its fill and moves onto another host."*

The description and depiction here does a fairly good job of casting depression as some sort of parasite— something that latches onto a host and drains it of its vital, positive energy.

As has been the case with all of these of these little monsters, they are separate from the human, and we get a unique opportunity to visualize something apart from the person having some negative effect on the person.

### Relevance in Our Community

Depression affects almost 7% of adults in any given year, and almost 17% of people will experience depression at some point in their lifetime (American Psychiatry Assoc.). In the U.S., that's about 21 million and 51 million people, respectively. Odds are that you've come across someone with some form of depression in your lifetime, whether you were able to identify it or not.

When it comes to making our moves, trite cliches like "Just be kind" and "We have to come together" don't work for enacting change, because they are non-specific and really have no actionable value to them. If we're going to do something about helping people with depression, we need to be specific about what we actually should and should not be doing. Here are some suggested "Should"s and "Should not"s for us to consider:

*We Should:*
- Allow our friends and family to tell us how they are feeling without interrupting them,
- Ask guiding questions of others that can lead to a better understanding of their experience with the symptoms listed earlier in this edition,
- Search for professional help on behalf of our loved ones, with their knowledge and consent,
- Make sure these people know that you are there for them and will actually listen to what they have to say.  

*We should not:*
- Tell people to "stop feeling" any certain way. This is the most fruitless and counterproductive thing you can do (e.g. "Stop being a sad sack," "Can you stop crying all the time?"),
- Tell others what you would do if you were them (you are not them),
- Ignore people that are experiencing depression because they "dampen your mood".
  
There are several other tips and tricks I could come up with, but ultimately the situation boils down to how much you care about others, and whether or not you will actually act on what you learn in a way that can help others. You can totally do this.

### This Week's Mental Health Hack

Do the things you were born to do. When you really think about it, there are certain things that only you can do in this life, given your unique set of experiences and talents, and if you don't do those things, nobody else will. It is so exciting and rewarding to be doing something solely because you feel like you were meant for it, and like it is precisely in your zone.

At the same time, it is more cognitively difficult to always be doing something that wears on you and doesn't give you life or joy. Find your zone and do your thing. Your brain will thank you for making its life easier.

### Weekly Challenge

The challenge this week is to stop wasting time. I did a self-audit recently, and I've been spending way too much time "enjoying" scrolling through Instagram, and I haven't been making progress toward some of my goals as a result.

Don't wait for another January 1 to make another set of temporary lifestyle changes. Start the change today. In reference to the mental health hack, I know what my thing is, I just have to go do it, and you should do the same.
