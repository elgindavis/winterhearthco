### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.


I'll be honest, learning about mental health isn't always the most exciting or interesting thing to spend time doing— at least on the surface. When we really begin to dive deep into the cosmos of mental health and we cultivate a richer understanding of these different ways that the body and mind can work for us as well as against us, we also begin to see things differently. We begin to see the humans around us in a new light. We begin to awaken to the internal dealings that people struggle with that we may have no idea about. We reach a new level of awareness in our heart that leads us to consider the other before passing judgment. Our collective voice begins to shift from one of passivity to one of strength and confidence, eager to protect and defend those who have been labeled, ridiculed, harassed, and mistreated their whole lives by a seemingly cold, unfeeling, uncaring, and uninterested world.

I believe that on the other side of our journey to understand mental and emotional health is a personal evolution— an internal evolution that begins in the heart, flows up through the mind, and manifests itself as love, empathy, and compassion in the physical world. It's also a personal revolution— a revolution against siding with the status quo and allowing society to continue to look down on our neighbors who struggle with these unseen conditions each day. The love we want to see is the love we have to give. The promise of this journey is what inspires me to write these editions each week, and what keeps me pouring into this project.

### What is Schizophrenia?
 
Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects the way an individual interprets reality, leading to a distortion in how they think, act, express emotions, and relate to others. *"Positive Symptoms"*, or symptoms that are present in people with schizophrenia and not in the general population, include hallucinations, thought disorders, delusions, and movement disorders. *"Negative Symptoms"*, or symptoms associated with disruptions to normal behaviors and emotions, include reduced emotional expressiveness, reduced feelings of pleasure in daily life, difficulty participating in and sustaining activities, and disorganized speaking. There are also cognitive symptoms that affect the individual's ability to understand and retain information. 

Schizophrenia is often confused with split- or multiple-personality disorders, though they are not the same thing. People with schizophrenia often times cannot distinguish what is real from what is being imagined, and the world begins to feel like an ocean of thoughts, noises, and images, in addition to the ones that actually occur in reality. In the short YouTube video from the National Alliance on Mental Health (linked in Resources section at the bottom), they give a pretty striking example:

> *"Imagine you're sitting in a room surrounded by 100 televisions, all on different channels with the volume turned all the way up. Now, try to concentrate on one of the televisions. Try to make out one single sentence. Now, imagine having that much noise in your head every minute of every hour of every day. Welcome to reality for 2.4 million American adults living with schizophrenia."* - **National Alliance on Mental Health**

They go on to note that for one individual it may be noises, but for another it may be some sort of other effect. The main distinguishing feature of someone who has schizophrenia is the loss-of-touch with reality, brought on by the different internal functioning of the nervous system. Direct causes of schizophrenia are not crystal clear at the moment, but genetics, malnutrition before birth, defects in the brain's neurotransmitters, and substance abuse are currently believed to have some sort of connection to the roots of the disorder. The resources at the bottom of this edition give very solid information on the ins-and-outs of the topic if you're looking to learn more.

### Schizophrenia Abstracted
 
> *"The schizophrenia monster is a vile creature that manipulates its victims into doing its bidding. It uses hallucinogenic gases secreted [from] the pores on his underbelly to control and influence others to do what it wants. Its victims relate to the monster as a powerful and controlling voice inside their subconscious.*

> *It is often accompanied by other monsters such as Paranoia, with Schizophrenia taking up an authoritative role much like a mafia gang leader. They are rarely seen and like to hide in the shadows."*

Allen's depiction of Schizophrenia is really helpful in that he highlights that the character combines other mental disorders to produce various effects in different individuals. He also makes consistent use of the term 'victim' throughout all of these monster depictions, which seems to imply a sense of helplessness on the part of the individual. Many of these mental illnesses cannot be cured, per se, but the individuals who struggle with them can be treated and the effects can be mitigated to an extent.

### Relevance in Our Community

Back in Volume 1 of this publication ([Issue 12, specifically](/newsletters/volume-1/whats-in-a-word/)), I highlighted a deeply moving TED Talk from Elyn Saks, a university professor who struggles with two mental illnesses. She lives with schizophrenia and psychosis, and during the talk she gives us an overview of what it is like to struggle with such conditions, and to still continue to succeed and push forward to change the world around her.

One of the key moments for me from this talk was when Saks notes that she would rather be called “someone who has schizophrenia,” rather than “a schizophrenic,” or, even worse, “a schizo”. People throw around terms like these often, but we as a community should be aware of how that usage affects individuals living with those illnesses (from the voices I’ve heard so far, it doesn’t make them feel  very good at all).

This concept applies the same for any mental illness, and more generally for anything that people struggle with. Labeling people can often be harmful, even though it may be an unintended consequence. My biggest piece of insight here is to consider those consequences before you label someone, and to choose your language more carefully and thoughtfully.

### This Week's Mental Health Hack

In a word, adventure. Adventure is not only exciting and fun, but from the perspective of mental health, adventure gives you an opportunity to refresh your mind, to regain some perspective, and to dream while awake. Life can get pretty stale sometimes, especially when we fall into the same daily routine and begin to find ourselves just "phoning it in" and going through the motions. It's easy to lose motivation and inspiration in times like these, and a lack of adventure can put your mind into a pretty dense fog.

I've been having that exact feeling since the newness of my summer in Düsseldorf wore off a few weeks ago, and so this weekend I finally got out of the city and took a solo day trip to Cologne, a nearby German city. Cologne was cool and all, but what was even more exciting for me was the thrill of plunging headfirst into a new place, trying out (and failing with) my burgeoning German speaking skills, and just shaking things up. It ignited a sort of fire in me that I've missed since I left Boston, where I used to drag my friends along (willingly or unwillingly) on adventures throughout Massachusetts. If you feel like you're in a bit of a rut, it may be time for you to lace up your shoes, strap up your backpack, and take life for a nice little joyride.

### Weekly Challenge

Mantras are pretty powerful, not only because of the truth they bear, but also because they are short and easy to remember. If there was one thing you wanted yourself to remember this week what would it be? For me, this week my mantra is going to be "Have faith in the unseen". This isn't really coming from a spiritual perspective, but rather from the perspective of a content creator.

I sometimes get discouraged when I'm unable to see how my work is actually impacting people. It is tough sometimes to keep going when you get the feeling that nobody is really listening, but this week I want to remind myself to have faith that the work, energy, and passion that I'm putting out into the world is reaching the people that it is meant to reach, when it is meant to reach them, and that it's resonating with them in the ways that it's meant to resonate.
