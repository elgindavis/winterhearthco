### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.

I want to kick off this week's edition by thanking everyone who who reached out to me after last week's edition on Social Anxiety Disorder. I'm so glad to hear about the different ways that these weekly writings have been impacting you all and inspiring you to engage in your communities. It's wild to think about how a few months ago I started this publication as a way to share poetry with my family, and now each week we're diving into mental health concepts that will change the world, even if only on an individual level. 

This week we're taking a look at Sleep Disorder, so let's get started.


<br>

### What are Sleep Disorders?
 
There has been extensive research done on sleep in the past few decades, and it has become very evident just how important sleep is for living healthy and engaged lives. Sleep Disorders are a group of conditions that affect an individual's ability to regularly sleep well. Many people experience trouble sleeping in some form, but there are specific symptoms that most likely indicate a sleep disorder, such as:
- Irritability and/or sleepiness during most days
- Difficulty staying awake during non-intense tasks (reading, watching TV, sitting still)
- Falling asleep often while driving
- Difficulty concentrating
- Slow reaction speed
- Trouble controlling emotions
- Feeling the need to take a nap almost every day
- Being dependent on caffeinated beverages to get through most days

There are a number of sleep disorders, and they each have fairly unique effects. Here are some of the most common sleep disorders:
Insomnia— inability to sleep at night
Sleep Apnea— an individual's breathing temporarily stops during the night, awakening them frequently
Narcolepsy— uncontrollable daytime sleepiness
Restless-Leg Syndrome (RLS)— irresistible urges to move one's legs throughout the night
Shift Work Sleep Disorder— an individual's work schedule and biological clock are out-of-sync, most commonly seen in individuals who work night shifts, early morning shifts, or rotating shifts.
Delayed-Sleep-Phase Disorder— biological clock is significantly delayed, leaving the individual to be unable to sleep earlier than 2am-6am every day.
Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder— an individual's Circadian Rhythms are not synced with the natural cycles of day and night (imagine your body thinking that there were 25 hours in a day), leading them to go to sleep significantly earlier or later every day until they eventually come full circle around the clock, and the process repeats.

### Sleep Disorder Abstracted
 
> *"The Sleeping Disorder Monster is a playful creature that never rests. It will seek out a playmate or victim in the middle of the night and keep them awake to satiate its eternal boredom. Most often, the victim will get very little sleep, if any at all, stressing the victim and encouraging other monsters to join in with its games.*

> *If the monster finds its playmate already asleep, it will become enraged and will play a variety of nasty or harmful tricks on its victim. It can induce nightmares or night terrors by burning incense from its tail. It can cause sleep apnea by wrapping its tusk around the victim's neck. It can even sit on various body parts to temporarily paralyze its unwilling playmates. These are just a few of the many tools at this monster's disposal."*

One thing I like about this depiction by Allen is that it shows how there are multiple types of sleep disorders, represented by the different "tricks" that the monster plays on its victims. The character itself does look a bit nightmarish and dream-like itself, which connects well with the idea of sleep. It's also pretty important to note how Allen describes the monster as a "playful creature". In past editions where we looked at major anxiety disorders, the disorders were largely driven by some sort of biologically-induced fear (OCD, Social Anxiety Disorder), whereas with sleep disorders, we don't have that same element of fear.

### Relevance in Our Community
Sleep disorders are real, and it's often more than just a matter of telling your friends and family to "go to sleep earlier". Last week I alluded to an example of people giving advice around mental health issues that they simply don't understand. The advice generally isn't helpful since it is not coming from a place of actually understanding the underlying issues, though the individual usually means well in offering advice. Telling someone with a sleep disorder to just go to sleep earlier is about as helpful as me trying to tell a plant how to grow. I'd imagine the same idea applies to most instances where people give advice, but especially as it relates to mental health we should seek to be more understanding and to be better listeners.

</div>

If you really want to help someone dealing with sleep disorder or any other mental health disorder, read up on the disorder that they have. Learn more about what your friend is really struggling with and what they actually need from you (which is probably not more advice). Help them find a licensed professional that can address the underlying issues. Educate others (gently, of course) on your learnings around mental health. You have so much power to change the landscape of mental health, and it all starts by being curious and having the boldness to act on that curiosity.

### This Week's Mental Health Hack

The Mental Health Hack of the week is to make what I call "Mood Playlists". A Mood Playlist is basically a collection of songs (I use Spotify) that all align with a certain mood or emotion that you want to feel, exaggerate, or even pull yourself into. When I'm feeling low-energy, I have a playlist to get me hyped up and ready to continue. When I'm just relaxing, I have a playlist for that too. When I'm feeling a bit blue, I have a specific playlist that I listen to to experience that emotional connection and hear something some other human created while experiencing something similar that I can relate to at that moment.

Music allows us to feel and express things that we may not have been able to come up with in our own words or imagine for ourselves, and it's a wonderful gift to be able to maneuver through different emotional states with the aid of music.

### Weekly Challenge

This week's challenge is simple, but simple doesn't always mean easy. This is something that I've been trying to challenge myself to do recently, and it is certainly not easy! The challenge is this: Use the word 'I' less than 20 times each day. Now, why is this a worthy challenge? The way it makes sense to me is that the more time we spend talking about ourselves in conversation, the less time we allocate to practice empathy and learn about the other person in conversation.

</div>

<br>

A few weeks ago, I was talking with a friend (see how easily that 'I' slipped in there?) about how in a conversation, each response has the ability to be a pull response, in which the individual pulls the attention toward themself, or a push response, wherein the individual pushes the spotlight to the other person or people. Make note of how often you pull, versus how often you push. Roughly speaking, the more you can shift the conversation to the other person, the more you can learn about them and get to know them better, while at the same time increasing your skillset for empathizing with others. Maybe you don't get down to 20 I's in a week, or even a month, but by keeping track, you'll at least become conscious of how often you pull the attention toward yourself in a conversation and you'll know exactly where to begin developing.
