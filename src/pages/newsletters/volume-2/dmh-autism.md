### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the final edition of the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.

This is the last edition of Volume 2: Demystifying Mental Health, so you won't be getting any more emails from me for a while. I saved this one for the end because, unlike the rest of the topics we covered in Volume 2, Autism is not an illness. You'll learn more about that shortly.

I hope you enjoy learning more about it in this final edition, and as I said in last week's edition, thank you so much for joining me on this journey to learn more about mental health. I've learned so much over the past few months, and I really hope that you have too. Feel free to directly reply to this email with any questions or comments you have about Volume 2, and I hope to see you in the future. I wish you the best in everything life has in store for you, and I hope that this newsletter project has had a positive impact on you and your life in some capacity. I've never done anything quite like this before, so hopefully it was useful for you :) 

Without further ado, let's get into our last edition of the series.

### What is Autism?
 
Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a broad neurobehavioral condition characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, and speech as well as nonverbal communication skills. In the U.S., ASD affects 1 in 59 kids, so just under 2% of kids, which is around 6 million kids in the U.S. for better perspective. ASD manifests itself differently in each child, which is why it is identified on a spectrum (the 'Spectrum' in Autism Spectrum Disorder).

I've heard people make jokes about other people being 'on the spectrum' when they do something seemingly without thinking, which is actually incredibly disrespectful to people who have autism. There are actually several disrespectful things that people do and say pertaining to people with autism, potentially without even knowing it. Two that immediately come to mind are the limp hand repeatedly hitting the chest (usually accompanied by some sort of contorted/cross-eyed visage), and the use of the 'r' word. These things are used by comedians, musicians, artists, and regular people all over the world, and it is pretty disgusting to see how insensitive and ignorant people can be.

Autism is usually identified in childhood, and this is where most of the strongest symptoms occur. Children with autism have trouble communicating, empathizing, and expressing themselves, and at times they also have trouble with seemingly ordinary sensations (smells, touch, sights, sounds). Symptoms typically appear in the first 3 years of life. Autism is not something that can be 'cured' per se, but it is rather a set of characteristics that accompanies an individual throughout life.

The following is a list of social/behavioral symptoms from NIMH that someone with autism may exhibit:

- Making little or inconsistent eye contact,
- Tending not to look at or listen to people,
- Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others,
- Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or to other verbal attempts to gain attention,
- Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversation,
Often talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving others a chance to respond,
- Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said,
-Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like,
- Having trouble understanding another person’s point of view or being unable to predict or understand other people’s actions.
(NIMH, 2019)

At the end of the day, while ASD is indeed a diagnosable condition, it is just that — a condition — rather than an illness, as the other disorders we covered in this series were. People with autism are people just like you and me, just with differing sensibilities.

### Autism Abstracted
<br/>


> *'Just like its effects, the Autism monster comes in many forms with different impacts on those it touches. It carries an ever-changing lens that can distort and present a different view of the world than what others see. This can lead to trouble understanding social interactions, difficulties when communicating and leaves the affected person's senses in overload. However, this unique view can also impart positive qualities such as an intense focus and attention to detain, a remarkable memory or a heightened intelligence and imagination.*

> *The Autism monster is more friendly than most mental conditions and is a lifelong companion, sometimes becoming a valued part of everyday life to those who are affected by it.'*

I think this description, as well as the charming character beside it, is simply beautiful. You see, Autism is not an illness, nor is it something to be cured. Being different isn't a negative thing, and Autism especially has a hand in the shaping of some really cool, unique, and interesting people.

### Relevance in Our Community

People with Autism are often called 'weird' (or, more often, a worse name that begins with an 'r') by people who are not only disrespectful enough to label anyone as such, but also by people who lack the empathy to really try and understand someone's different behavior and sensibilities. I've known quite a few people with autism in my life, and I find it really upsetting when other kids (and even adults, really) target them, label them, bully them, and harass them for being different. We as a society are quick to label discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, etc. as exactly what it is: discrimination. However, when it comes to neurobehavioral differences, as people with autism have, people seem to think that the case is different. It is still discrimination, and there's no place for it.

### This Week's Mental Health Hack

This is the last Mental Health Hack of the series, and instead of reaching for some grandiose, mind-blowing hack that nobody has ever heard of or tried before, I'll keep it simple: Give the love you wish to receive. I believe that one of human's highest callings in life is to love and to be loved, and if you want to be loved, you have to be willing to love others first.  
<br >  

#### What does that look like in practice?

Ask deeper questions about others, showing them that you care about the personal details of their life. Remember names. I don't believe there's any validity to the all-too-common excuse 'I'm bad with names'. It's a half-baked excuse that people use to hide behind their lack of effort. Listen to people when they share, and don't indulge in the urge to project your life experiences onto theirs. There are some people that I talk to where I can sense that once they ask a question, they are just waiting for their next turn to talk, or they just jump in as I am talking, indicating to me that they believe that what they want to say is more important to them at that moment. Don't label people (negatively). Adjectives are great for describing nouns, but when they are used to describe people in particular, they carry more power than you may realize. Your words matter, even in secret. What you say is at some level what you think and believe. Remember that the tongue is a double-edged sword. Give without expecting anything in return. Things like this newsletter and my past mission trips are ways I like to give to others, sharing things I've learned and helping people better themselves. The only thing I really want is to know whether or not I've made a difference in someone's life.

The list could go on forever, but I think you get the point. My brain is always stronger when I'm loving others than when I'm tearing them down, and I know that it will be the same case for you.

### Weekly Challenge

You've gained so much knowledge about mental health at this point that you're basically an expert. As an expert, you can now go forth and make the world more empathetic, caring, and considerate as it relates to mental health. Make your art, have your conversations, write your thoughts, do whatever it is you do to communicate, and do it with the knowledge presented in the past dozen newsletters.

You have everything it takes to start the fire, which is exactly what we need in the cold, dark, and gloomy world that we sometimes find ourselves living in.
 
<br />  

### Walk It, Talk it

This is the end, my friend. I'm not crying, you're crying. But really, thanks so much for coming along with me all the way to the end. It is only the beginning of our respective journeys, and I hope our paths cross again some day!  

<br />  
Until next time, Elgin
