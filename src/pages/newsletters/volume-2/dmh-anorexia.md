### What's New This Week

Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.

With only a few editions left to go in Volume 2, you've come such a long way in your understanding of the major mental health disorders. It's really amazing to see how many people have been keeping up and committing to learn this content. Don't be afraid to put your new knowledge to the test— try to explain the basics to your friends and family, try to identify different symptoms in the people you come across, fill in the blanks for people who haven't learned too much about these topics just yet. Knowledge isn't power until it is applied (like I say at the bottom of each of these editions :) ), so take advantage of your new knowledge as often as you can.

### What is Anorexia Nervosa?

Anorexia Nervosa (usually shortened to 'Anorexia') is a crossover between mental health disorder and eating disorder, which is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss in an individual. People with this disorder have a fear of 'becoming fat', and struggle a lot with appearance issues, much like individuals struggling with Body Dysmorphia Disorder (which we covered last week). There are a number of possible causes for the disorder, but no definite causes have been identified as of yet. Research suggests that it may be linked to heredity, feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and inadequacy, and possibly even toxic relationships. In any case, the disorder is defined by an extreme fixation on weight loss and severe restrictions on the amount of food eaten. People with anorexia often equate 'thinness' with self-worth, and this is often a major root of the disorder.

### Anorexia Nervosa Abstracted

"As a parasitic assassin, Anorexia Nervosa slowly kills its victims from the inside. This monster is almost invisible, thanks to its translucent body, but it casts its shadow on those it inhabits, causing its victims to see a warped image of themselves. It manipulates and controls its victim, convincing them to maintain a minimal body weight by restricting food intake and encouraging excessive exercise to lose what it perceives as 'extra' weight.

The ultimate goal of Anorexia Nervosa is to make its victims destroy themselves through starvation and other health complications that arise due to its manipulation. The main powers of this monster are control and secrecy which cause its victims to try and hide their extreme habits. In order to defeat Anorexia Nervosa, its existence must be acknowledged, only then can its powers be rendered useless. It is common for Anorexia and Body Dysmorphia to work together."

This week's creature is very visually interesting, and also very insidious. Anorexia Nervosa is one of those things that will eat away at you unless you acknowledge and address it, as noted in Allen's image. It is also definitely worth noting that Body Dysmorphia Disorder, which we covered last week, works hand-in-hand with Anorexia Nervosa. BDD you'll recall has a lot to do with fixating on a perceived flaw and going to extreme lengths to "fix" it or conceal it from sight. Anorexia Nervosa focuses mostly on weight and keeping it as low as sustainably possible. This is a sneaky one, and it doesn't always appear in a rail-thin body frame, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled to see if anyone you know exhibits any of the symptoms listed in the below section.

### Relevance in Our Community

Looking to our community, there are a number of symptoms that can help us identify anorexia in an individual. Of course, actual diagnosis should come from a professional, but your attention to others could help someone see their need to consult a professional where they otherwise may not have done so. Some of the symptoms of anorexia include:

- Rapid loss of weight over several weeks or months,
- Continued dieting and/or restricted eating even when thin or light in weight,
- Intense fear of gaining weight,
- Strange eating habits, such as eating in secret,
- Feeling "fat", even if underweight,
- Inability to realistically assess one's own body weight as through pounds or kilograms,
- Perfectionism and habit of being very self-critical,
- Excessive influence of body weight or shape on self-esteem,
- Depression, anxiety, irritability,
- Frequently ill,
- Wearing baggy clothing to hide weight loss,
- Compulsive exercising,
- Feeling worthless or hopeless,
- Social withdrawal

### This Week's Emotional Health Hack

People often feel like they complain too much or are more negative than they would like to be, but there is a case to be made for venting as a way to process emotions. Venting is not the same as complaining. Venting, when done properly, has an underlying goal, while complaining is mostly unguided expression. That underlying goal oftentimes may simply be to stop experiencing a negative emotion (or at least to diminish its strength). It may also be to better understand what it is you're feeling and find the root cause, or any of a number of different things.

Think of venting like the "exhale" side of the breathing cycle. When we inhale, our body takes in and processes the oxygen and other particles that enter our lungs, and then we are left with particles that need to be released for us to continue functioning. Inhaling is like the act of experiencing things in life, which can then be processed in the body and registered as emotions. The toxins that result, or the negative emotions in this case, need to be released in order for us to stay healthy. I haven't come up with a name for what I want to call this concept, but I just thought of it this week so I'll have to get back to you on that ;)

In order for us to remain mentally and emotionally healthy, we must breathe. To refuse to process emotions and release the negative sentiments is like a kid holding their breath until they get the toy they've been begging for. So, in short, vent like you mean it.

### Weekly Challenge

If you happen to be the social-media-type, then this is the challenge for you. If you aren't, then I challenge you to a hot-dog-eating contest instead. My record is like 3 or something. Anyway, social media has become infamous for its brutal comment sections and indifferent users, as well as interactions devoid of meaningful sentiments (I didn't want to get all poetic, but can we just take a minute to think about how pointless 'likes' are?). That is... until this challenge! If you're anything like me, you've been guilty of scrolling through your friends' photos, maybe liking a photo or post, maybe not, and not saying anything.

I challenged myself a few weeks ago for a few days to comment something positive on every post I saw (aside from the popular comedy pages I follow... ain't nobody got time for that). As you might imagine, I got tired quickly and got off social media (unintended win), but for the time I was on it, I found myself really making the effort to comment something meaningful on each post (which was admittedly tough, because some of the people I'm friends with on Facebook whose posts came up are almost perfect strangers and I don't know how or why they are on my friends list). I found myself being more empathetic, more likely to think about the person behind the post and the actual human life being lived outside of the context of that post. I had forgotten about this idea until I got around to writing this week's challenge, but I think it's time to start it up again!
