### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, seeking to spark positive, empathetic, and meaningful conversation around mental and emotional health.

This week, we're talking about ADHD. "ADHD" is a term I hear flung around everywhere, from people making jokes about having short attention spans, to very real insults on the ability of an individual to focus or remember information. The current conversation around it is probably the most glaring example of negative discourse surrounding mental health, and that's something that this publication seeks to change through increased awareness, deeper understanding, and concrete action. Let's take a closer look at what the term "ADHD" really means, and what we can do to make the conversation more positive.

### What is ADHD?
 
As many people know, ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and it is one of the most common mental disorders that affect children, though it also affects adults. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that about 8.4 percent of children and 2.5 percent of adults have ADHD. The manifestations of ADHD, like most of the other mental health topics that we address in this volume, begin on biological and chemical levels (this is also why medication is often used and is effective in assisting with ADHD symptoms). In the case of ADHD, the the symptoms stem from differences in the development of the brain that relate to the [executive function areas](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/executive-functioning-issues/3-areas-of-executive-function) (which include ability to focus, self-control, organizational skills, use of working memory, and more), and usually begin during childhood. Adults tend to have a slightly different set of symptoms ([which you can read about here](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#1)), but are generally related to things like anxiety, depression, disorganization, impulsiveness, etc. For kids, there are generally 3 categories of symptoms that result from ADHD: **inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity**. 

- **Inattention**— kids with ADHD may have a much harder time paying attention, concentrating, and focusing on any given task. They may seem absent-minded and like they are not listening for most of the time.
- **Hyperactivity**- think restlessness, fidgeting (those trendy fidget-spinners come to mind), and a general inability to remain still and engaged in a situation.
- **Impulsivity**- this symptom often manifests itself in kids as an inability to wait for things. Patience is hard enough as it is for people without ADHD (read, this day and age is saturated with the idea of [instant-gratification](https://positivepsychology.com/instant-gratification/)), and it's so much more difficult when chemicals within your brain are causing you to act in ways that you otherwise wouldn't.  

There's a lot to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and I'd encourage you to check out some of the extra resources at the end of this edition. One of the best resources that I found when writing this was an article written by a mom who has a son with ADHD. At the time of writing, her son was 6 years old, and she recounts some of the very tough, all-too-common experiences she has had with her son's ADHD and how other people perceive them in public places. Get your empathy fix for this week and [check out the article](https://www.understood.org/en/community-events/blogs/what-i-wish-id-known-sooner/2016/10/20/8-things-i-wish-people-knew-about-parenting-a-child-with-adhd) to learn more about what that experience is like.

### ADHD Abstracted
 
> *"The ADHD monster is a tricky fiend that usually makes its presence known in childhood and in many cases likes to stay with its host until adulthood. The monster's fast movement, bright colouring and fluttering wings echo audio and visual stimulus to distract and draw the host's attention. This makes it hard for the host to concentrate on everyday tasks and disrupts basic or complex thought processes as their attention and thoughts jump from one thing to the next.*

> *The monster can also magnify and focus on a certain audio or visual clue or even a thought, making it hard to focus on anything outside of that one thing. ADHD's overflowing energy can also have an [effect] on the host, making them feel restless and agitated, further providing [a] distraction to everyday activities."*

Allen's depiction of ADHD is a very well-thought-out representation of what the disorder might look like if it were some sort of creature. Even the detail with the contrasting colors and vibrating glitch effect (the red and blue color channels being slightly drawn apart, as you might see when you watch a 3D movie without the proper eyewear) gives us a foothold into thinking about ADHD in a different way. Allen mentions the fast movement, distractions, and inability to concentrate on everyday tasks as we saw in the above section. You might even think of this creature as a representation of the chemical imbalance that occurs with ADHD, but most importantly, we have to realize that these symptoms are not the fault of the individual. This is where our empathy has a chance to grow the most.

### Relevance in Our Community


People use and misuse the term "ADHD" all the time, as mentioned in the intro to this edition. In short, as members of our global community, the least we can do is stop calling people "ADHD". It's insulting and it also minimizes the reality that it is a very real situation that many people deal with, and we should not only respect that fact, but we should do more than our fair share to help. We can help educate others, help people with ADHD with whatever they need, and even help parents who seem to have their hands full with a kid with ADHD. There are so many things we can do to help, but it all starts with a heart to want to understand and help others who may be different from ourselves.

### This Week's Mental Health Hack

Mental health hack of the week: writing down what you are feeling, both in negative situations and positive. it often is hard to really understand everything that goes on in our minds until we see it on paper. There's a great quote by Joan Didion: “I don't know what I think until I write it down.”

The same concept applies to feelings. It's hard to understand and to accurately label and assess these feelings until we take the time to process them on paper. There's something quite magical about writing things out by hand, and this could be the one mental health hack you need to take your life to the next level.
