### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, gleaning useful and practical insights to become more socially and emotionally powerful. 

Following last week's digest, [The Curiosity-Driven Life](/newsletters/volume-1/curiosity-driven-life), this week is all about the Gift of Gratitude. Gratitude is powerful. Gratitude has the power to transform entire mindsets from negative and hopeless to positive and optimistic. To be truly grateful is to appreciate every aspect of life, taking the good with the bad, and choosing to use it to move forward rather than to stay in the same place or to regress. Gratitude allows us to be humble and to understand that there are forces in this world beyond our control, and also to understand that neither our successes nor our failures come completely by our own hands. The gift of gratitude is a gift of healthy perspective, and a healthy perspective is key to enhancing your reality (check out our edition on The Pursuit of Perspective here for more on the topic).

If you're reading this edition, I'm immensely grateful that you've committed time and energy to support this endeavor of mine, and I really hope that you have been inspired and empowered by the content I write for you each week.

As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.

### Listen
 
This week's Listen section comes from The Gratitude Podcast, an uplifting podcast hosted by Georgian Benta that aims to inspire 100,000 people to discover how to feel grateful more often and live a happy life. The episode in particular I checked out was called "The Easiest Way To Change Your Life" with Dave Meltzer. Meltzer is the CEO of Sports 1 Marketing, he was CEO of the world’s first smartphone, and he later became CEO of the world’s most notable sports agency, Leigh Steinberg Sports and Entertainment. These accolades become relevant in the episode, I promise.

In this episode, Meltzer talks about how living in a grateful mindset, regardless of the situation, may be a guaranteed way to actually achieve happiness in life. He also denotes **four pillars** for living a successful life: 
- **Gratitude**, which gives you a healthy perspective on life's events; 
- **Empathy**, which allows you to forgive and be grateful for all of the mistakes that you and others have made; 
- **Effective Communication**, which allows us to connect to that which inspires us, and then add value to it to in turn empower others. 
- **Accountability**, which allows us to take responsibility for our behaviors and ask two questions: *"Did I do something to attract this thing to me?"* and *"What am I supposed to learn from it?"*


There's plenty of great wisdom in this short episode, so check it out below to learn more.

### Learn
 
In this week's Learn section, we explore the therapeutic effects of giving and receiving compliments. In this TED Talk by Tracie Broom, we take a deeper look into what's really going on inside of us when we give and receive compliments. With respect to gratitude, complimenting others in very specific, intentional, and genuine ways can be huge in fostering and nurturing relationships. Being thankful for the positive aspects of another person not only helps to maintain your positive perspective, but it also gives you the opportunity to empower and encourage others to do the same when you communicate your gratitude to that person in some way, as we heard similarly in the episode above from Dave Meltzer. Check out the talk to learn more.

### Level Up
 
This week's Level Up section digs into the art of the compliment, and how to go about constructing meaningful compliments to show your gratitude to others. Making compliments that seem genuine is something that I personally struggle a lot with, and this article was really helpful for me. I'm grateful for so many things about so many people, but sometimes it can be difficult finding the words to say what you mean without sounding hollow or patronizing. Check out the article for some key tips on making compliments.

### Fireside Spotlight

This week we have another exciting artist feature, this time from [Esteban](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6LWaCBkJRURey6t09EbgRr), another young, motivated, and up-and-coming artist in the Boston area. I had the pleasure of getting to work with Esteban the past few months in a poetry workshop at Harvard, and his music, talent, positivity, and overall energy has been really inspiring to me and to all of the other artists that we had the opportunity to work with. Keeping in line with the spirit of gratitude, I'm really grateful that through the Epic Life Playbook I'm able to connect with different artists and creators like Esteban who are changing the world every day.

Check out his most recent song, [Pavement](https://song.link/i/1460504941), on all the major music outlets!
