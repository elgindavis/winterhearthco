### What's New This Week
Welcome back and thanks for joining us again in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook, where each week we explore the human experience through different mediums, gleaning useful and practical insights to become socially and emotionally powerful. 

Following last week's digest on [Building Your EQ](http://eepurl.com/gm_Xbb), the theme of this week's content is Under Construction. A few months ago, we looked at how the people, places, ideas, and perspectives we encounter every day work to refine the frameworks through which we view life ([check out the playbook edition here](/newsletters/volume-1/maximizing-potential), back when we were the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!). It's often helpful to think of these frameworks as being "under construction", because if your mental framework is too rigid and unchanging, it becomes easy to get stuck in one mindset and become "closed-minded". 

It's also worth noting that there is just not enough time in a lifetime to assume that one's mental framework can ever be "fully constructed" — because as humans we are always learning, always growing, and always evolving. This week's content is great to refine those perspectives.

As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.

### Listen
 
This week, we're going to check out a really cool podcast called Something You Should Know. The selected episode highlights a common form of discrimination that we may often overlook and even commit ourselves if we aren't careful. They shed light on the things that having an overly-solidified mental framework can lead to — you won't want to miss it!

### Learn
 
In this week's Learn section, we're back with another great episode of Ear Hustle. This episode is really great in the way it humanizes inmates and even allows them to seem personable, though we who live on the outside of those grey walls might not always be able to see it so clearly. Check out the episode "The Birdbath and the Lockbox" from Ear Hustle below!

### Level Up
 
This week's Level Up section presents you with a quick article from Premium Beat. The article covers different ways to keep your perspective fresh and ways to keep yourself from becoming "set in your ways", so to speak. It's written relative to a video/film editor, but the ideas apply just as well to anyone trying to boost their creativity and design as epic a life as possible. Check out the article below!

In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw our first character — Westro, a witty outlaw from the south side of town who loves robbing ice cream shops for popsicle sticks. This week, we're back with another thoughtful, poetic piece from Winter Hearth Studios called "Here Comes a Thought":
 

## *Here Comes a Thought*
 
*Maybe the heat of hot, streaming tears is where true strength is found*  
*Maybe kindness is impossible, implausible, intangible*  
*Maybe words are more than bricks piled high in clean façades*  
*Maybe you’ll skip town and never come back*  


*Maybe the still water lies in wait, ready and willing to breathe her first breath*  
*Maybe there’s beauty in a spider crafting its web*  
*Maybe the morning dew is a warning that goes unnoticed*  
*Maybe the big bug is looking down at you under the lens*  


*Maybe sundrops quench our thirst more than water ever will*  
*Maybe the symphony of blue frogs won’t wake the sun today*  
*Maybe today is the day when the shadows finally fight back*  
*Maybe looking up to you never was a good idea*  


*Maybe we can do better, and maybe we really can’t*  
*Maybe our bliss rests among the stars, but no one ever remembers to look up*  
*Maybe the feathered stretch of nightfall is only big enough for one of us, and*  
*Maybe the dark unfurling abyss is where you secretly long to be*  


*Maybe there are worse things in life than death*  
*Maybe it’s time for Atlas to take a break — I’ll carry the world for a while*  
*Maybe I’ll be the one to stand in the gap*  
*Maybe this stark silence really is deafening*  


*Maybe heat lives in fear of the cold*  
*Maybe nature’s first green wasn’t gold*  
*Maybe the sky really isn’t blue*  
*Maybe my words are reading you*  


*Maybe when song and dance just won’t do,*   
*We strike the red music and charge up the blue,*    
*Maybe I'll live on without you,*   
*And maybe one day I'll feel whole.*
