Welcome to the More Human Podcast! I've been thinking about starting this podcast for years now, and the time has finally come. 

In this podcast, we'll explore the intersection of mental and emotional health and modern culture. The journey won't be easy, but the life we've always dreamed of is lying just on the other side. Get ready to learn, grow, and evolve along with me as we discover how to tap into our humanity and live the most meaningful lives possible.
