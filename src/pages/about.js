                                Hey there! I'm Elgin and I'm the human behind Winter Hearth Studios. I started this creative studio back in 2018 as a place for me to dream— to dream of ways that we can connect better with each other as humans and ways for us to live deeper, hyper-meaningful, and greatly fulfilling lives for ourselves.

                                The idea behind Winter Hearth is to create a warm sense of home amidst the biting cold and chaos. The "hearth" is where the fire is. It's where we go to be restored, reinvigorated, and revitalized. It's where we find the power in our voices, the motivation to overcome, and the inspiration to create something awesome.
