If you've seen any form of news at any point in time, you're probably familiar with the fact that there's no shortage of terrible events happening around the world. Tragedy strikes day after day, and whether you realize it or not, each of these events you learn about and care about has an effect on you in some way, shape, or form.</p>\n<p>Though many of you have awesome, huge hearts, our compassion is sadly not unlimited and does indeed come with a cost. Compassion fatigue is generally defined as a unique form of burnout, characterized by a gradual lessening of compassion as a result of constant engagement with heavy emotional situations and challenges (<a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2011/408024/\">Jennifer R. Day &#x26; Ruth A. Anderson, 2011</a>). In other words, compassion fatigue may be described as the process of becoming desensitized to people who are suffering or are in need of help. The phenomenon is exaggerated and most commonly observed within the caregiving professions, because workers in these professions face constant \"heart-wrenching, emotional challenges\" (<a href=\"http://www.compassionfatigue.org/pages/compassionfatigue.html\">Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project, 2019</a>), such as those who deal with death and mortality on a daily basis (doctors, firefighters, police officers, etc.). There has also been some argument among journalism analysts suggesting that news media have played a large part in dramatically increasing compassion fatigue throughout our society by utilizing stories of extreme tragedy and suffering outside of their proper contexts.</p>\n<p>In short, <strong><em>caring comes with a cost</em></strong>. If you feel like you have some degree of compassion fatigue, you're certainly not alone. The great thing is that there are plenty of ways by which you can start to overcome compassion fatigue once the initial awareness is present.  Check out this week's content to learn more about compassion fatigue and to learn exactly what you need to do to overcome yours.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Cynthia-Bond%3A-%E2%80%9CRuby%E2%80%9D-(An-Oprah%E2%80%99s-Book-Club-Selection)-id1347950-id137461847'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bf332dd-ba71-422b-b1fa-dd4d7631b6a9.jpg' alt='Oprah SuperSoul logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>This week, we're back with Oprah and another SuperSoul conversation. In this episode, Oprah speaks with Cynthia Bond, author of the best-selling book \"Ruby\", which deals with the heavy topic of sexual abuse. Bond talks about how she uses writing to process emotions and experiences, and also to tell a powerful story that has hit home for many readers. I've yet to read the book, but I'm definitely adding it to my list.</p>\n<p>The conversation also brings us back to the idea of compassion fatigue in the sense that reading emotionally heavy, dense material can wear down on a person's mental health if they aren't aware of the effects of the content being consumed. The same idea applies to music, film, art, and anything else we consume. That is, of course, not to say that we shouldn't engage with emotionally powerful material, but rather to shed light on the fact that these things affect us in ways that we might not readily perceive, and that we must become more aware of these subtle effects in order to care for ourselves properly and maintain a solid mental health state.   </p>\n<p>Without further ado, here's the conversation with Oprah and Cynthia Bond!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Cynthia-Bond%3A-%E2%80%9CRuby%E2%80%9D-(An-Oprah%E2%80%99s-Book-Club-Selection)-id1347950-id137461847'>Check out the episode!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://www.ted.com/'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7562a1b3-fe3f-4a93-835a-9d349ccb5f3d.png' alt='TED logo'>\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, I want to provide you with a number of links to TED Talks concerning Compassion Fatigue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsaorjIo1Yc\">Drowning in Empathy: The Cost of Vicarious Trauma</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7keppA8XRas\">How to Manage Compassion Fatigue in Caregiving</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-4m35Gixno\">Compassion Fatigue: What is it and do you have it?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These talks do a good job of defining compassion fatigue and where it occurs most often, and they even give a few tips for combatting this increasingly-common form of burnout in today's society.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/29b777ca-e504-4e39-a43c-919e0fbcbd87.jpg' alt='Woman with head down on a desk'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\">\n        Photo by Abbie Bernet on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>In this week's Level Up section, we have an <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/high-octane-women/201407/are-you-suffering-compassion-fatigue\">article published in Psychology Today</a>, further outlining compassion fatigue and giving <strong>concrete steps for dealing with this sneaky form of burnout</strong>.

This week, we'll see a piece from Winter Hearth Studios, inspired by the recent trip to Barcelona. The piece is entitled La Sagrada Familia, and is named after the famous, under-construction temple being built in the northern part of the city. The building has actually been under construction for 100+ years, but it's expected to finally be completed (long after its initial architect and designer has passed) around the year 2026.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 8% 0;\">\n<h1>La Sagrada Familia</h1>\n<div style=\"margin: 0 18%; text-align: left\">\n<em>\n<p>Alighting sweetly from the several stories above,<br>\nEach saint takes his turn swaying in the<br>\nCherished, cheery light of the<br>\nStained-glass windows;<br></p>\n<p>Filtering the rays of the sun as they tell<br>\nThe story of the raise of the Son from<br>\nThe calamity of unknown yet certain death into<br>\nThe calmness of unbounded, everlasting life.<br></p>\n<p>The great temple stands tall — mighty, yet unfinished.<br>\n<p>Seafoam-green shards of light<br>\nDash the ground in a dizzying spell,<br>\nWhile cherry-red drops trickle down from the<br>\nSolid, rose-colored treetops<br></p>\n<p>Which provide no shade, for the<br>\nTruest light emanates from below the unmoving trees.<br>\nFastened tightly with nails of injustice,<br>\nThe granite Son shines from beneath the stone.<br></p>\n<p>Spires reach toward the heavens<br>\nLike a distress beacon, casting lamentations<br>\nDestined to fall upon deaf ears.<br>\nDestined to drift upward into the frigid void.<br></p>\n<p>Truth, hollow as the sanctuary halls,<br>\nTruth, hallowed as the art of sacrifice;<br>\nNothing good comes without sacrifice.<br>\nNothing worthwhile comes without a paid price.<br></p>\n<p>Forevermore, there will be another block to be laid,<br>\nAnother brick to be placed, another request to be made,<br>\nAnother flourish to be carved, another story to be told,<br>\nAnother light to be shone, and another stone to be rolled.<br></p>\n</em>\n</div>\nby <strong>Elgin Davis</strong>\n</div>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!
