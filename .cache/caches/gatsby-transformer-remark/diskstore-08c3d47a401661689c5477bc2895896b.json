This is one of the core tenets of emotional intelligence. The ability to recover from negative emotions will change your life drastically, because regardless of what happens to you, if you have trained this skill, adversity will lose its power over your emotional state. In practice, this often means putting life in greater perspective when negative events happen. For example, spilling a cup of coffee and being debilitated by the event for the rest of the day is not managing the emotional state correctly (please don't cry about spilled coffee... or milk... just don't do it). Instead, in developing your EQ, you might realize that in the grand scheme of life, a spilled cup of coffee is probably the least of your worries, and you collect yourself and carry on with the day.","position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":36,"offset":3816},"end":{"line":55,"column":817,"offset":4597}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":1,"offset":3781},"end":{"line":56,"column":1,"offset":4598}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Be mindful of your vocabulary","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":5,"offset":4603},"end":{"line":57,"column":34,"offset":4632}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":3,"offset":4601},"end":{"line":57,"column":36,"offset":4634}}},{"type":"text","value":".

This is similar to steps 5 and 6 from the article â€” choosing your words to accurately convey what you are thinking is crucial in developing your EQ.

In the same Medium article referred to in the last point, I note that the most important way to practice empathy, perhaps, is to refrain from assuming things about people, especially things that seem to make sense to you but may not actually be true. The example I give in the article is the assumption that because someone hasn't responded to a text message for a few hours that they must be ignoring you or they must be upset when, in reality, you don't always know for sure what may actually be going on in someone else's life.

Knowing what pushes your buttons makes it easier to manage those negative emotions before they ever arise. For example, you know that you are going to be enraged if your child comes home late for the fourth time this week.

You are then able to collect yourself and prepare for a more thoughtful (and less terrifying) interaction when Timmy does finally arrive past curfew.","position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":26,"offset":5813},"end":{"line":60,"column":506,"offset":6293}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":1,"offset":5788},"end":{"line":61,"column":1,"offset":6294}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bounce back from adversity","position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":5,"offset":6299},"end":{"line":62,"column":31,"offset":6325}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":3,"offset":6297},"end":{"line":62,"column":33,"offset":6327}}},{"type":"text","value":". There are plenty of trite expressions about \"bouncing back from adversity\", but there is a reason for this. The thing about adversity is, growth is necessarily uncomfortable. If we weren't pushed from our comfortable, centered emotional states, we would almost never have the opportunity to grow as people. We'd probably just stagnate, never improving or developing these skills. For example, failing a test in school or a project at work does not necessitate dropping out of school or quitting your job. No, in fact, the adversity has just shown you what you need to improve on, and when you make the choice to accept that challenge, you build up that mental muscle of resilience that will probably come in handy one day in the future.","position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":33,"offset":6327},"end":{"line":62,"column":771,"offset":7065}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":1,"offset":6295},"end":{"line":62,"column":771,"offset":7065}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":1,"offset":3781},"end":{"line":62,"column":771,"offset":7065}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'> Check out the full article!</a>\n</div>\n \n<br>","position":{"start":{"line":64,"column":1,"offset":7067},"end":{"line":68,"column":5,"offset":7350}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'/>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>","position":{"start":{"line":70,"column":1,"offset":7352},"end":{"line":75,"column":7,"offset":7621}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Fireside Spotlight","position":{"start":{"line":77,"column":5,"offset":7627},"end":{"line":77,"column":23,"offset":7645}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":77,"column":1,"offset":7623},"end":{"line":77,"column":23,"offset":7645}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In last week's Fireside Spotlight, we saw a piece called \"","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":1,"offset":7647},"end":{"line":79,"column":59,"offset":7705}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/la-sagrada-familia-23cd1ec70b67"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"La Sagrada Familia","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":60,"offset":7706},"end":{"line":79,"column":78,"offset":7724}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":59,"offset":7705},"end":{"line":79,"column":144,"offset":7790}}},{"type":"text","value":"\" from Winter Hearth Studios.
