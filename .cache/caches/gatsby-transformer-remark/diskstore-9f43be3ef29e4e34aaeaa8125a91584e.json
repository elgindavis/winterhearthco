The event was absolutely tragic, and my heart goes out to the victims and those affected. During the speculation, it seemed to be perplexing that anyone would do such a thing, and it was very quickly suggested that there was a strong possibility that the woman suffered from mental illness. I have found that in these situations of murder, mass murder, suicide, etc. that people still throw out mental illness very early as an explanation when they can't fully understand the reasoning for some person to do something, and while it is quite possible that the woman suffered from a mental illness, associating the fact that someone did something \"unthinkable\" with mental illness is very much unfounded.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, if someone is going to suggest that mental illness is a probable cause for something taking place, they should be able to identify which specific mental illness they are talking about, because contextless generalities like \"she was probably mentally ill\" are the reason why the state of mental health awareness is as it is today and why I write this newsletter each week.</p>\n<p>As I noted a few editions ago, I struggle with my own mental illness, and for someone to say that mental illness in general makes people do horribly violent things very much affects me and the way that other people perceive people like me who have mental illnesses. None of the mental illnesses we've covered so far \"make people violent\". </p>\n<p>Bottom Line: The woman very well might have been suffering from a mental illness, but if someone is to say that the mental illness caused her to do something like this, they should have a concrete idea of which one they are referring to and the relevant symptoms. It is not right to conclude that mental illness causes people to do horrible things just because someone can't fathom other possibilities or motivations. People do many things for many reasons. Mental illness has been the scapegoat for explaining the motivations for violent crimes for far too long, and per the goals of this newsletter, we're working to fix that.  </p>\n<p>With that said, this week we're covering Post-traumatic Stress Disorder— another huge topic in the American community.</p>\n<br />\n<h3>What is Post-traumatic Stress Disorder?</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is born out of a traumatic experience. The disorder can actually stem from witnessing something traumatic happen to someone, as well as experiencing the traumatic event oneself. Every traumatic experience doesn't result in PTSD, but pretty much every instance of PTSD does stem from some form of trauma. The most common forms of traumatic events that lead to PTSD are combat exposure, childhood physical abuse, sexual violence, physical assault, being threatened with a weapon, and accidents. There are plenty of other examples, but you get the main idea from these examples.</p>\n<p>As we noted in an earlier edition of this playbook, PTSD is classified as an Anxiety Disorder, which you may recall is a specific psychiatric disorder that tends to involve crippling fear, worry, or apprehension, typically accompanied by compulsive behavior or panic attacks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into 4 types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and lastly changes in physical and emotional reactions. </p>\n<p>Intrusive memories may appear something like a war veteran reliving a particularly gruesome moment during a war, or even a person's recurring memories of a their dad physically abusing their mother decades ago. The intrusive memories don't always occur in the same scale of time, as each individual and trauma is unique.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of Avoidance may include physically avoiding people, activities, or places that remind the individual of the particular traumatic event, or simply trying to avoid thinking about the event(s) that took place.</p>\n<p>Negative changes in thinking and mood can include negative thoughts about the self or the world, hopelessness about the future, memory lapses, lack of interest, and feeling emotionally numb, among other things.  </p>\n<p>Finally, changes in physical and emotional reactions may include symptoms such as being easily startled, always being on-guard in case of danger, self-destructive behavior (e.g. drinking excessively, driving too fast), irritability, or even sometimes aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>As if the trauma itself wasn't already enough, people who experience PTSD live significantly altered and hampered lives as a result of that trauma. PTSD is a pretty complicated disorder as far as symptoms and treatments go, but this should give you the basis for understanding and possibly even identifying it in the world.</p>\n <br />\n<p><img src=\"/img/newsletters/ptsd.jpg\" alt=\"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The post traumatic stress monsters were once part of a race of benevolent guardians who became corrupted by a painful and unknown malady. Left a twisted shell of their former selves, the monsters began to crave the intense rush of fear and trauma to dull their own pain much like a drug.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monsters can be found stalking battlefields or lurking near traumatic events and natural disasters, feeding off the collective trauma and fear. They will then seek out individuals involved and stalk them, becoming a constant reminder of that pain. Victims are forced to relive the terrifying moment over and over again while the monster feeds on the destructive energy. The PTSD monster is part of the same family as the anxiety monster.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of PTSD is overall a really great illustration in my opinion, though the story accompanying it seems like a bit of a stretch. If you remember all the way back to the beginning of this volume when we saw the Anxiety monster, you'll notice how they have the same colors and both wear a skull mask. This is a really cool way of representing that they are in the same class of disorders— Anxiety Disorders, specifically. You'll also notice the arrows piercing the body of the creature, representing the wounds that have been inflicted and the trauma that has occurred.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg\" alt=\"Relevance in Global Community\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>When thinking about relevance, the first obvious thing that comes to my mind is war veterans, but as briefly highlighted earlier, trauma can take many forms (e.g. abuse, losing a pet, untimely death, etc.). Anybody can experience trauma, and odds are that most people have. If they haven't, they likely know or have read or heard about who has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event.</p>\n<h4>Bottom Line</h4>\n<p>Let kindness be the default when you interact with people (difficult people especially). You may never know what is going on outside the small slice of their life that you exist in or how they got to be the person that they are now.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in light bulb vases\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Let them go. I have a habit of trying to hang on to people who are falling away from me, and I've had this habit for at least a decade now. As I'm trying to become mentally healthier and more solid, I've realized that sometimes you just have to let people fall away. They will come back into your life if they are meant to.\n<em>Mic drop, single tear hits the floor</em></p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg\" alt=\"Child looking at stairs\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>Seriously, let them go!
