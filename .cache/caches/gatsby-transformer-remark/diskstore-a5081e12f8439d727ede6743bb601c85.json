This is because I actually struggle with Social Anxiety Disorder myself. Admitting you struggle with a mental health concern doesn't always have to be this heavy, silence-and-awkward-conversation-inducing event as it's made out to be so often in society and in the media. This isn't some Alcoholics-Anonymous-meeting style of admittance (Hi everyone. Hi. I'm Elgin and I have Social Anxiety Disorder. Hi Elgin.). It's really just me making you aware of something that I personally struggle with in my day-to-day life, just as we all struggle with things on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>As I've been noting in the past few editions, our mental health concerns don't define who we are as people, and Social Anxiety Disorder doesn't define me, though I happen to experience it first-hand. I'll take you through a bit of what that's like for me later in this edition. I'm not going to use the acronym, because that would just be SAD (sorry, low-hanging fruit).</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What is Social Anxiety?</h3>\n<p>Social Anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders in the world. It is estimated that about 15 million American adults have Social Anxiety Disorder. In the first edition of Volume 2, we covered anxiety disorders in general, and we noted that there are 5 types of Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. You might recall that an anxiety disorder is usually debilitating, paralyzing, or crippling in some way, and can greatly inhibit the victim's ability to carry on regularly in their every day life.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/b622a5a5-6968-4335-95e0-8e56001f2df0.gif' alt='Interesting blob person lying awake at night, blinking'/>\n</div>\n<p>When people first hear or learn about social anxiety, they usually lump it in the same category as 'shyness'. However, there are a few key differences that we need to take into account. The first difference is that shyness is a personality trait, while social anxiety is a condition that exists on a chemical level. Individuals like myself who struggle with social anxiety disorder aren't necessarily shy, though people who don't fully understand how it works often label me and others as being shy. Social anxiety is usually driven by an increase of adrenaline, which leads to an increased heart rate, and cortisol, which is the primary stress hormone. People who have SA experience these increases primarily in social situations as the brain determines that these situations call for a serious biological response. The second major difference between SA and shyness is that SA is also rooted in fear of some unwanted event happening, though the fear is often irrational and unwarranted.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/3d07bdd6-8a10-4fcf-b3a5-4a8e1a1eddb8.gif' alt='Spongebob hyperventilating'/>\n</div>\n<p>A common theme that you'll see with many mental health concerns is that rationality cannot always simply overpower the biochemical wirings of the brain. As such, many people, including me, struggle with how their brain is currently wired.</p>\n<p>People who have Social Anxiety Disorder usually have trouble in one or more of the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talking to strangers</li>\n<li>Dating</li>\n<li>Speaking in public</li>\n<li>Making eye contact</li>\n<li>Entering rooms</li>\n<li>Using public restrooms</li>\n<li>Going to parties</li>\n<li>Eating in front of other people</li>\n<li>Going to school or work</li>\n<li>Starting conversations</li>\n<li>Physical human contact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And they typically have an overwhelming fear of at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being judged by others in social situations</li>\n<li>Being embarrassed or humiliated</li>\n<li>Accidentally offending someone</li>\n<li>Being the center of attention</li>\n<li>Major symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder include:</li>\n<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>\n<li>Muscle tension</li>\n<li>Dizziness and light-headedness</li>\n<li>Stomach trouble</li>\n<li>Inability to catch one's breath</li>\n<li>\"Out-of-body\" sensation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People with SA may start having symptoms immediately before an event, or they may begin worrying about it for weeks before the event ever happens. After the event, they might spend countless hours and lots of mental energy worrying about their social performance and mulling over their choice of actions.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/43c49082-25f3-411e-8e12-505f0d41e727.gif' alt='Crying gumball machine boy'/>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Story Time</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways that are believed to lead to the development of Social Anxiety Disorder, including an overactive amygdala (the part of the brain that controls the fear response), or a history of abuse, bullying, or teasing. There's one moment in particular in my life that I seem to be unable to shake that seems to exist at the very beginning of my social anxiety. When I was maybe 3 or 4 years old, I was in pre-school somewhere in South Florida. It was a warm autumn day, maybe even a Tuesday, and I had gummy snacks for snack time. Boy, was I excited for those gummy snacks. We started snack time and I got out my gummy snacks, ready to go to town. I started trying to open it, but it proved to be more than a little difficult for my baby-carrot fingers at the time. I pulled and pulled, until finally the bag burst open and the gummies flew in all directions all over the floor. So what did I do next? Yep, you guessed it. I started crying. Just kidding, I really wanted those gummies. Instead of standing there crying, I bent down to the floor and popped the gummies into my mouth, one-by-one, carpet hair and all. I wasn't at all prepared for what happened next. Everybody in the entire class had stopped what they were doing and all 40+ eyeballs were fixed on me, watching me eat food off the floor. The blank stares were then followed by waves of \"Ew, that's gross!\" and \"You're nasty!\", and even the teacher added in a \"That's gross, what are you doing???\" As you could imagine, I was thoroughly humiliated, and for a 3-year-old boy, such a moment does quite a number on the brain and psyche.</p>\n<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7f77e480-fcd1-4565-9471-5fbac1a36c27.gif' alt='Crying gumball machine boy'/>\n</div>\n<p>Ever since then, I have this looming fear of failing (and thusly being ridiculed or humiliated) in social situations such as that one. My phone alarm went off one day in one of my computer science lectures in college (back when I went to lectures) and the anxiety, sweat, and adrenaline consumed me so much that I just got up and went home in the middle of class. I touch my face probably no less than 200 times a day out of fear that there is something on my face that nobody told me about and that people will ridicule me for. I get cold sweats anytime we go around a room and have to introduce ourselves, fearing the thought of stumbling over my name or not even being able to articulate who I am to a room full of strangers. I have a huge anxiety around physical contact, and fear messing up handshakes, making incidental eye contact with strangers (or even people I know, really), being that 'really awkward hugger guy', or just being a weirdo when it comes to platonic touch (like touching someone's shoulder) in conversation all plague me on a daily basis. Sure, these fears may seem irrational. That's because they probably are, but the thing with mental disorders is that rationality usually doesn't get a say in the matter when the biochemical responses are in charge.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"/img/newsletters/social-anxiety.jpg\" alt=\"Social Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Social Anxiety, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<p>I spent a good bit of time on the above section, so I'll keep this one short. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Social Anxiety monster spends most of its life underground or in secluded sheltered areas. Because of this their skin appears pale and anaemic apart from hard plates that serve as an unnecessary means of defence. They are from the same biological family as the anxiety and paranoia monsters but due to their extreme way of life they have evolved to look quite different.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monster spends most of its time in hibernation but will project their auras into human hosts, in the hope of living out the ordinary lives they can never have. In the process, the monster passes its own anxieties to its victims so both monster and the human host experience similar irrational social fears or worries.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really resonate with the \"unnecessary means of defence\" piece, because for the most part, nothing bad will usually happen as a result of what people with social anxiety actually fear. It's also a very characteristic piece, with the monster literally turning its back to us, shielding itself from any interaction with others.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg\" alt=\"Relevance in Global Community\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>As noted in the definition section, about 15 million adults in the U.S. have Social Anxiety Disorder. There are plenty of people for us to help, we just have to look a little harder and approach the situations in different ways. I'll start with the most unhelpful thing we can do. For myself in particular, when I'm talking about something I'm struggling with related to my anxiety, the most unhelpful things people say to me include \"it's all in your head\" or \"you're just overthinking things\", or worse, \"stop being so negative/anxious all the time\". I'd say that these things are generally unhelpful for anyone with a mental disorder, and they show a lack of true empathy or really any kind of intent to understand. People struggling with social anxiety disorder don't need you to tell them what to do or how to think and certainly not how to feel, and if we're being completely honest, most of the people giving out these instructions and bits of advice don't really know what they are talking about anyway, though their intentions may be pure.</p>\n<p>What they need from you instead is simple. Love and support. Be there to listen. Make them feel heard, listened to, and understood. You probably don't understand their anxiety if you don't experience it for yourself, so telling them what to do about it really doesn't make any sense. They need your love more than they need your advice. Comfort them when they are feeling anxious. Don't pressure them to do anxiety-inducing things. Notice when they are showing signs of being anxious (for me, I think it'd be really nice for someone to see me rubbing my face and to gently tell me \"Hey, you're okay. There's nothing on your face. All good.\"). Ask them questions. Get them to open up about their anxieties so that you can comfort them in those situations. In essence, just be a friend.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in light bulb vases\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>The Mental Health Hack of the week is to create something that helps you express something you've been feeling. The creation can be anything— a drawing, a painting, some music, some writing, a poem, a story, a list— just something that you enjoy doing that also addresses a major emotion you've been feeling over the past week. I've been able to do this with the characters I've been drawing, and just manifesting those thoughts and feelings in another form allows me to engage with them in a way that I can't exactly do internally.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg\" alt=\"Child looking at stairs\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is simply to notice. I challenge you to pay specific attention to the emotional states of others around you. How do you think they are feeling? Why might they be feeling that way? What questions could you ask to help them? Do you care how they feel? Why or why not? Challenge yourself this week to be more observant and inquisitive.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook! In the words of Dale Carnegie, \"Knowledge isn't power until it is applied.\" How can you apply the ideas in this digest to your life? How can you use it to gain power in living a more epic story?
