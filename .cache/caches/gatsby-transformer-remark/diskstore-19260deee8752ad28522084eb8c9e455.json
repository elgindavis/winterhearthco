Sometimes all it takes is striking up an intentional conversation, sharing a post, sending a thoughtful text message to a friend, or making a good, old fashioned voice call (it's 2019, what are those?) to someone you care about to create a massive ripple of positivity and a surging wave of change.</p>\n<p>Last week we kicked-off Volume 2 with a brief introduction as to why this series exists, and a focus on understanding anxiety, anxiety disorders, and the difference between the two (if you missed last week's edition, you can find it here). As I mentioned last week, anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders worldwide, so if you yourself don't struggle with one, there's a pretty good chance that you've come across someone who does. This week, we'll uncover the most essential things for you to know about one of those anxiety disorders: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder— more popularly known as OCD.</p>\n<h3>What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?</h3>\n<p>As noted in the intro and in last week's edition, OCD is classified as an anxiety disorder, which is a class of specific psychiatric disorders that tend to involve crippling fear, worry, or apprehension, typically accompanied by compulsive behavior or panic attacks. To better understand what exactly Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is, we will separate it into its two parts: Obsession and Compulsion. According to the International OCD Foundation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>Obsessions</strong> are thoughts, images or impulses that occur over and over again and feel outside of the person’s control.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>Compulsions</strong> are repetitive behaviors or thoughts that a person uses with the intention of neutralizing, counteracting, or making their obsessions go away. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a nutshell, someone with OCD is unable to resist having recurring and usually disturbing thoughts, nor can they resist the fear, worry, or apprehension that those thoughts cause. In an attempt to quell these extreme anxieties, the individual performs repeated, sometimes even ritualistic behaviors that are intended to make the obsession stop. People with OCD understand that the behavior doesn't necessarily solve the problem, but they are unable to manage a better way to cope than a temporary suppression of the obsession. Take a look at the following illustration to see how OCD works from a high level overview.</p>\n<div class='pt-20 pb-20 text-center'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/13c3396b-954d-42d1-8481-a418e1c094e3.jpg' alt='OCD cycle chart' />\n</div>\n<p>It is important to note here that \"obsession\", as defined here, is used differently than many people use it in modern language. People talk about \"obsessing\" over something or \"being obsessed\" with something when they really like that thing— be it a new show on Netflix, a new song, a Vine or YouTube video, an app, etc. This, of course, isn't true obsession. Individuals with OCD often feel like the misuse of the terms diminish their very real struggle with OCD symptoms. </p>\n<p>With true obsession, an individual can't keep their mind from fixating on a certain thing to the point of those thoughts disrupting their daily life consistently. In the case of OCD, the fact of the matter is that people with the disorder don't even want to think about these things, nor do they want to act on these thoughts— they just want the thoughts to stop, and are compelled to doing certain things in an attempt to do so. With OCD, it's not that your friend is a \"neat freak\". They may have cleanliness as an actual diagnosed obsession, and are compelled to keep their room as clean as possible out of fear that something really bad might happen if the room is the slightest bit out of order. As we saw last week with anxiety disorders in general, the driving force of this class of mental illnesses is often fear of something disturbing, unpleasant, or unwelcome happening.</p>\n<p>Many people have \"intrusive thoughts\" from time to time, but those thoughts don't trigger extreme anxiety that interferes with life on a daily basis. The obsessions we're talking about here are time-consuming, unwanted, and get in the way of a person living the life they want to live, which is not the same thing as someone who simply likes to keep things clean or orderly because of a personality trait.</p>\n<div class='pt-20 pb-20 text-center'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/a5c689d9-75c0-4148-ac5e-58f0a0b45193.gif' alt='repeatedly straightening shoes' />\n</div>\n \nThere are a number of categories of common obsessions:\n<ul>\n<li>Contamination (ex. fear of contamination by body fluids, fear of diseases like HIV)</li>\n<li>Losing control (ex. fear of stealing things, fear of acting on an impulse to harm others)</li>\n<li>Unwanted sexual thoughts (ex. perverse sexual impulses about others)</li>\n<li>Religious Obsessions (ex. fear of offending God)</li>\n<li>Harm coming to others (ex. fear of being responsible for something terrible happening)</li>\n<li>Perfectionism (ex. concern with evenness or exactness, concern with a need to  know or remember)\nThere are also a number of categories of common compulsions:</li>\n<li>Washing and cleaning (ex. washing hands excessively, excessively cleaning household items)</li>\n<li>Checking (ex. checking that you didn't make a mistake, checking that the door is locked)</li>\n<li>Mental compulsions (ex. counting while performing tasks to end on a \"safe\" number)</li>\n<li>Repeating (ex. rereading, rewriting, repeated tapping)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A brief aside as we conclude this section— when we call someone \"OCD\" because of any of the above obsessions, compulsions, general behaviors, or really any other reason, a number of things happens. The first thing that happens is that we actually diminish the validity of the very real mental health disorder that many people suffer from by misusing the term. Another thing that happens when we call someone \"OCD\" is that, whether you realize it or not, we are identifying them by their mental illness. People who have OCD don't enjoy having it, they don't enjoy being labeled by it, and, I can't stress this enough, they are not defined by the mental illness that they suffer from. In the same way that it is ignorant to call someone with a physical limitation 'a cripple', it is also ignorant to call someone with a mental illness by their mental illness. They don't make light of it, and neither should we.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"/img/newsletters/ocd.jpg\" alt=\"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The obsessive compulsive monster is a cruel and manipulative puppeteer that uses fear to control its victims. It repeatedly pounds its staff on the ground and uses its patterned feathers and many eyes to hypnotise its victim, creating intense and frightening obsessions often linked to the safety of themselves or people close to them. Victims develop compulsions to carry out repetitive tasks or mental acts to prevent the obsession from coming true or to attempt to temporarily reduce the fear.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The monster is almost never seen but its presence is almost always there. Anxiety and Depression monsters are often used by the OCD monster to keep a hold on its victim.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's choice to depict OCD as a puppeteer is really interesting, but I think that it fits with what has been uncovered about OCD. People with OCD are made to fear certain things taking place, and they are led to take certain actions in order to prevent those things from happening, whether the logic of it makes sense or not. Allen's description hints more toward the fear linked to the safety of the self or people close to the self, which is one of the categories of obsession that we saw in the previous section.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg\" alt=\"Relevance in Global Community\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>As of June 2019, the term \"OCD\" is searched in Google 165,000 times per month. Like the term \"anxiety\", OCD is widely misunderstood, though hopefully you have a good understanding after reading through the above sections. In terms of the community, Help Guide gives us useful tips for supporting someone who has OCD:\n<strong>Avoid making personal criticisms</strong>- these are symptoms, not character flaws\nDon't scold someone with OCD or tell them to stop performing rituals- they cannot simply stop the compulsive behavior when they want, and you will put more pressure on them by doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Be as kind and patient as you can be</strong>- the individuals need to be able to fight the disorder at their own pace. Cheer them on in their successes and focus on the positive elements happening in their life\nDon't play along with the rituals- helping with rituals may reinforce the rituals, which is counter-effective to overcoming the disorder\nKeep communication positive and clear- let them know that you are there with them and don't add extra stress to the situation by being negative\nIn addition to these tips, there are more resources in the Resources section at the bottom of this edition.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in light bulb vases\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>This week's Mental Health Hack is something I've been doing since January. After coming back from my South Africa mission trip, I was inspired to start a journal that I write in each day with the positive and negative things that happened that day. I went a step further and added a column called \"Big Moods\", which captures the major emotional states that I recall experiencing during each day. I also keep a list of emotional descriptors at the top of the file to refer to in case I am having trouble pinning down a certain emotion.</p>\n<p>This has been a good tactic for me to not only engage more deeply with the events that took place on any given day, but it offers me time and space to reflect on how those events actually made me feel, which is a major key in developing emotional intelligence. Being the nerd I can be sometimes, I put this journal into a document in Evernote as a table (much like a table you'd find in Google Docs or Microsoft Word) so that I can have it with me wherever I go, and also so that whenever I am ready, I can write code to analyze my entries for all sorts of cool insights like most common feelings, most positive months, most negative months, people who have had a profound impact on my life, etc.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg\" alt=\"Child looking at stairs\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>I challenge you to say 'hi' (with a smile, of course) to at least one stranger this week.
