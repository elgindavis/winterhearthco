Making this edition of the playbook created a radical positive shift in my life perspective, so I hope that reading it will do the same for you.</p>\n<p>This week's content is all about how living in pursuit of curiosity rather than passion can actually be just what you need to live your best life. We often hear metaphors likening passion to fire, portraying it as a bright, brilliant source of energy and symbol of life and hope. That's definitely something that we try to embody here at Winter Hearth Studios, but as most of us know, there's usually more to any metaphor than meets the eye. Fire can also be destructive, of course, as we unfortunately just saw with the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France. Fire can burn, hurt, consume, and demolish if it is allowed to run its own course.</p>\n<p>Curiosity, on the other hand, does not consume us, but rather it allows us to edify ourselves and move unhurriedly through the phases of life, enjoying each moment and interacting with the world around us in a more meaningful way. (\"Curiosity killed the cat\" sounds nice and is easy to remember, but it is not really accurate...)</p>\n<p>So how can this understanding of curiosity connect you to living a better life? That's exactly what we'll aim to answer in this week's content.</p>\n<p>As always, there's plenty of content here, so feel free to just take what you need.</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/5bf332dd-ba71-422b-b1fa-dd4d7631b6a9.jpg' alt='Listen'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Listen</h3>\n<p>If you consume just one piece of content this week from the ELP, this podcast should be the one. This episode comes from Oprah Winfrey's Super Soul Conversations podcast, and is led by New York Times best-selling author Elizabeth Gilbert, and it's all about the \"Curiosity-Driven Life\".</p>\n<p>I won't spoil too much about the episode, but if you're someone who struggles to find their passion in life or you feel a bit lost or overwhelmed at the current place in your journey, your biggest questions will likely be answered in this wisdom-packed episode.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://castbox.fm/episode/Elizabeth-Gilbert%3A-The-Curiosity-Driven-Life-id1347950-id147602962?country=us'> Check out the talk</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0164d703-676a-4bad-97d4-458942a01a35.jpeg' alt='College-aged students jumping into the air together'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Learn</h3>\n<p>In this week's Learn section, we have a throwback to an article I published on Medium a while back highlighting \"8 Tips to Level Up Your Empathy Skills\". At its core, empathy is about understanding and sharing in the emotions and experiences of another person. In order to build and use this empathy, we must entertain a certain level of curiosity, leading ourselves to venture outside of our own mental frameworks and to try to wrap our minds around the emotions and experiences of another person.</p>\n<p>This curiosity may be as simple as pondering, \"I wonder what she is feeling right now.\" Whether or not you come to the correct conclusion, the simple act of engaging in that curiosity of the state of another person engages your empathic skills and allows you to pause long enough to consider the other's point of view and perspective.</p>\n<p>When imagining two people having an argument, passion usually finds itself in the mix, and that very same fiery passion usually ends up burning one or both people in the process. Genuine curiosity, however, is not consuming, nor will it burn, but it will in most instances actually lead to a greater sense of empathy and self-control for those who engage with it. Read (or re-read) the article below for a deeper look at how curiosity can radically transform your interactions.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://medium.com/@elgindavis9/8-tips-to-level-upyour-empathy-skills-86ed0bc24790?source=friends_link&sk=e8d98c16041603986f55afdd99f542ee'> Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/70851790-9a7c-4f5b-834d-7207335fe488.gif' alt='Level Up'>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Level Up</h3>\n<p>This week's Level Up section explores a really great article about curiosity as a major component in successful relationships. The relationships we experience in life play a huge role in our mental and emotional health, and as we saw in the Learn section, curiosity is a driving force in building our empathy for others.</p>\n<p>You may be familiar with the social experiment \"<a href=\"http://36questionsinlove.com/\">36 Questions to Fall in Love With Anyone</a>\" (if not, familiarize yourself from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=36+questions+to+fall+in+love&#x26;rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS657US657&#x26;oq=36+q&#x26;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.2378j0j4&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">this Google search</a>). Why do scientists think that asking these 36 questions will help anyone fall in love? The basis of it, as we've seen throughout the rest of this digest, is using curiosity as a tool for building empathy. These questions are particularly personal, but in asking these questions, it seems to the answerer that you really want to get to know and understand them on that personal level, and that you are actually curious/interested in knowing the response. As the person who asks each question, you are building your ability to understand and share the emotions and experiences of others with each question asked which, as noted in the Learn section, is the very definition of empathy.</p>\n<p>This is such an awesome topic, and I hope you dig into it deeper. Perhaps you can even practice the 36 questions with yourself and get to know yourself a little better! The mentioned article does a great job at tying these ideas in with research to help us make logical sense of these phenomena, and there are a lot of solid action steps to be taken from both of these resources.</p>\n<p>tldr (too long, didn't read) â€” Ask personal questions of people more frequently to build better relationships.</p>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' class='primary-btn' href='https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_curious_people_have_better_relationships'> Check out the article!</a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/44635994-05b0-4f93-9110-f4c83f8bf9d9.jpg' alt='Campfire at night'>\n    <p class=\"photo-credit\"> \n        Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash\n    </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Fireside Spotlight</h3>\n<p>This week we have a guest artist feature from a personal friend of mine who goes by the name phoxx.tail. Their music is really chill and thoughtful, and does absolutely evoke a \"curious\" vibe when listening to it. A local Boston artist, phoxx.tail makes low-key, lo-fi beats that allow the mind to rest and relax. The exploration of sounds and unique ideas and melodies comes together really well in the several brief and colorful tracks that I listened to, and they show how curiosity can and does drive artistic expression and creation.</p>\n<p>I always love to see what members of the Firestarter community are up to, so if you have anything you'd like to share with the world, be sure to send it in! I'm looking forward to listening to more awesome tracks from phoxx.tail in the future, and if you hang out on Soundcloud, check out and follow phoxx.tail for some dope music and chill vibes!</p>\n<br>\n<div class='text-center pt-20 pb-20'>\n    <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://soundcloud.com/phoxxtail'>\n        <img src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/0170a64f-eedf-41b9-8a39-a3f7a9243640.jpg' alt='phoxx.tail'>\n    </a>\n    <br>\n    <a class='primary-btn' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://soundcloud.com/phoxxtail'>\n        Check out phoxx.tail on Soundcloud\n    </a>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Creative Journal!
