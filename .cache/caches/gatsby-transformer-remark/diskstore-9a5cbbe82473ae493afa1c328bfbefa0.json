In his notes, he states that every project in life can be reduced into 3 primary components: Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items. Action Steps are the specific, concrete tasks that move the project forward (i.e. send the email, make the phone call, watch the lecture. Note how these are all verb-based statements). Though we have introduced the idea of \"slow-motion multitasking\" in the Learn section, remember that you can only focus on one action step at any given moment, but you can work on action steps across multiple projects within the same larger-scale time frame (i.e. a day, week, or month). References are the project-related documents, notes, sketches, manuals, website links, or discussion that you may want to refer back to at a later point to accomplish your Action Steps. Finally, we have the Backburner Items, which are the things that are not currently actionable but may become actionable at some point in the future.

Among the many great things about Asana are the facts that it is free for individual use, you can actually create \"projects\" within the app that have their own space and sets of tasks, and the main task view splits your action steps into sections based on due date. For References, I use Evernote, because it is also free, it allows you to save your notes in the cloud, and you can even \"clip\" web pages and other online content directly into your Evernote notebooks. Ideally, each project in Asana would correspond with a notebook in Evernote if you were to choose this route for organization.
