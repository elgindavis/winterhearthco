Perhaps a star athlete comes to mind— someone who has major talent and deserves to win a championship or medal.

Those examples have a common issue: They share the perception that actions serve as a trigger to the universe that some outcome should happen.

Merit implies a certain worthiness or fitness for an outcome to happen based on demonstrated achievement, ability, or the like. Tommy would certainly merit that promotion based on his work ethic and history, but that still doesn’t entitle him to have the position. That is to say that he also doesn’t “deserve” it (nor does anyone else). The difference between merit and entitlement is that merit is at least more objective in deeming why a certain result should occur. Even then, there is no universal law that says that the things that should happen will happen. This is why expecting should’s to always translate to will’s isn’t a reliable perspective framework. Tommy's hard work and attention to detail may increase the likelihood that the employers choose him for the position, but we can’t sensibly assign further meaning as to whether or not he (or anyone else) “deserves” the position more than the rest.","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":5273},"end":{"line":20,"column":1007,"offset":6279},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":5273},"end":{"line":20,"column":1007,"offset":6279},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"But what about the things we all actually deserve?\nI expect many burning questions in response to this idea, such as: “What about deserving to be treated fairly?” “Are we not all entitled to be treated equally?” “What about deserving a right to live and be happy and safe?” “What about deserving to be loved?”","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":6281},"end":{"line":23,"column":259,"offset":6590},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":6281},"end":{"line":23,"column":259,"offset":6590},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"These are all great things that we all understand, value, and appreciate, but what does it really mean to deserve them? These are tenets that must be present to form strong human relationships and a well-functioning, fair society for sure. However, to “deserve” these things means that we did something to earn them, and thus we should be entitled to have them. “Deserving” is really the wrong word here, and it’s also the wrong way to think about these matters. Let’s analyze one of these questions:\n“Why do I deserve to be treated fairly?” > Because all people should be treated fairly.\n“Why should all people be treated fairly?” > Because societies built on fairness are more trusting and amiable.\nIn this example, the situation is actually not about being deserving at all— it’s about the goal of building a trusting and amiable society. Even so, our belief that something (even something good) should happen still does not mean that it will. If we base our frame of reality on what we believe should happen, life will fail to meet our expectations more often than not. If we want something to change, we change it based on the underlying root goals and facts of the matter— not based on something flimsy like human entitlement.\nAs another example, I could say that I deserve to not have to deal with racial discrimination. It would be really great if nobody had to encounter this, but that belief by itself does not change any outcomes. Societies function much better when people don’t discriminate against each other, but that fact has little to do with my personal ‘deserving’ of anything. If you believe something needs to change, do something to change it. It is certainly helpful to have hope for these really nice things, and it's even better to have the passion and boldness to do something about it. Even so, I consider it to be pointless to expect the idea of entitlement to change even a single outcome— even if it is a great candidate for the should universe.","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1,"offset":6592},"end":{"line":29,"column":743,"offset":8567},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1,"offset":6592},"end":{"line":29,"column":743,"offset":8567},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bottom Line\nThe bottom line is this: the concept of “deserving” is rooted in human pride and ego, rather than in gratitude and humility.

There’s no way to truly measure how deserving someone is of some outcome, so what is the function that it serves in a healthy mindset? The beauty here lies in the understanding that once we check our egos and stop wasting energy on speculating the things we “rightfully deserve”, we can focus our energy instead on making our desired outcomes more likely to happen and on being grateful for everything positive that we actually receive.
