No major updates from this side, so let's get right to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Body Dysmorphic Disorder</strong> is a mental disorder where an individual will obsess (remember obsession from the OCD edition?) over a physical flaw— whether perceived, imagined, or real— for hours and hours each day. Many of us have something that we wish we could change about our appearances and other similar insecurities, but those qualms don't always necessarily disrupt our daily lives. This is the case of BDD.</p>\n<p>Are you starting to notice a pattern with mental disorders we've been covering in this volume? These disorders are all very disruptive to daily life and they are often time-consuming as well. With BDD, sometimes the object of fixation goes regularly unnoticed by others, but for the individual, it's prominent and is very often at the forefront of their mind— whether they want to think about it or not (I'd imagine they would rather not think about a flaw so constantly, if at all).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned briefly above, the individual will obsess over this perceived flaw, much as individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder do. Individuals with BDD may even perform compulsive and repetitive behaviors to try to hide or improve their flaws (think wearing certain types of clothes, avoiding mirrors, repeatedly checking mirrors for signs of improvement, excessive grooming, skin-picking, etc). BDD is distinguishable from OCD in that BDD deals exclusively with appearance, whereas OCD typically does not. People with BDD may also avoid social situations, in a similar fashion to individuals with social anxiety disorder, to attempt to avoid shame or embarrassment with their appearance. </p>\n <br />\n<p><img src=\"/img/newsletters/bdd.jpg\" alt=\"Body Dysmorphic Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Body Dysmorphic Disorder, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Body Dysmorphic Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"As a master of deception, Body Dysmorphic Disorder loves to work in concert with other monsters such as OCD, Anxiety, and Anorexia, amplifying their effects. With broken-glass-like shards on its abdomen, it acts like a distorted mirror, reflecting a false view of whoever looks into its reflective surface. This mirrored monster then weaves a web to trap its victim like a spider, and slowly eats away at their self-esteem and overall wellbeing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This causes the victim to become increasingly worried or preoccupied about a particular part of their body or overall appearance. They begin to believe that their distorted version is the truth. Victims will often try to conceal what they think is a defect, or worse, actively seek to change it themselves.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allen's depiction of Body Dysmorphic Disorder hits on the defining characteristic of the disorder: appearance. It's not that the individuals are conceited, narcissistic, or full of themselves, but in fact it's the complete opposite. The description makes this clear when it notes that the monster \"eats away at their self-esteem\". This a super interesting way to represent such a disorder, but it really resonated with me and some of the things I experience with social anxiety disorder that I noted a few weeks ago.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg\" alt=\"Relevance in Global Community\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>BDD affects about 1 in 50 adults in the United States. That's like having a whole state's worth of people on average (... looking at you Wyoming... why is Wyoming still a state?) who suffer from this disorder. It usually first appears in adolescence which, if you've been inside an American middle school or high school, makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>Opinions aside, the causes of BDD are generally unknown, as is the case with many of these mental disorders, but researchers are inclined to believe genetics, environment, trauma, and neurobiological factors (like serotonin) may be at play to some degree. \"Body Positivity\" is a major wave that has been on the rise in recent years, and it probably has to do with BDD at some level. I don't have any concrete tips for BDD (the links in the resources section have plenty of info on treatment and such), but the goal here is that you understand BDD at a basic level and can identify it in the world, and possibly help point an affected individual onto the right path to get the best help available.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in light bulb vases\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Puzzles, though adored by some and avoided by many, are deemed to be pretty useful ways of \"exercising\" the mind. With puzzles, the journey is more important than the destination, because the process of solving the problem is what allows your brain to stretch itself and draw new connections between different ideas and ultimately arrive at a solution. Some research suggests that solving puzzles can slow the degenerative effects of aging on the brain and also aid in the learning process.</p>\n<p>Puzzles don't always have to be games, though. Non-traditional puzzles can be used to stimulate our minds. Some worldly puzzles that I'm currently working on \"solving\" are learning German (which to me currently sounds like someone speaking with a mouth full of loose teeth), learning digital drawing, and learning animation. For each of these endeavors, the process of learning is like starting with a box of scattered or missing puzzle pieces and finding and connecting all of them one-by-one until the picture is complete (by whatever goal I set for myself). There's a certain childlike wonder and fascination I have with learning something new and, as it turns out, there are some added mental health benefits for doing this as well.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg\" alt=\"Child looking at stairs\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week's challenge is a simple writing challenge: Write down 10 things that you like about yourself. These things don't necessarily have to be physical. If this doesn't seem super difficult to you, that's great, because if we're ever going to reach a point of body positivity, we have to be able to recognize what we do like about ourselves as much or even more so than the things that we don't like.</p>\n<p>Many people struggle to appreciate themselves for who they are, and they struggle to feel comfortable in their own skin. If you've ever felt like this (I know I have), this would be a great challenge for you to start shaping your mind and your mental habits. Of course, there will always be things we want to improve about ourselves, but we can begin to address those things in a healthier way once we develop a healthier perspective.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Walk It, Talk it</h3>\n<p>Thanks again for joining us this week in the Winter Hearth Epic Life Playbook! In the words of Dale Carnegie, \"Knowledge isn't power until it is applied.\" How can you apply the ideas in this digest to your life? How can you use it to gain power in living a more epic story?
