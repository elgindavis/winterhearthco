You've likely heard or overheard at least one person in your lifetime say something to the effect of \"Your'e so bipolar, can you just make up your mind?\" Or maybe you yourself have even said something like this. We've covered in a few of the previous editions why statements like these are destructive, so I won't elaborate too much here besides to encourage you not to call people 'bipolar' or to diminish the severity of the disorder (and the reality of those who suffer from it) by using it in contexts as trivial as the example above.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h3>\n<p>Bipolar Disorder, also known as Manic-Depressive Disorder, is a condition in which an individual experiences extreme shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and ability to carry out daily tasks. We've noted in previous editions that many of these mental health conditions significantly disrupt daily activities, and this condition is no different. I often see and hear Bipolar Disorder misrepresented in our society (you can read about my gripe with Gucci Mane's rap song \"BiPolar\" in the Community Relevance section), most often related to people who change their minds often or seem to change emotional states from being happy to being sad very quickly. We're going to throw that out of the window and get down to what Bipolar Disorder is really about.</p>\n<p>To get a general understanding of BD, there are 3 words we need to understand: Mania, Hypomania, and Depressive. Mania is a state of high energy and abundant excitement, and also potentially irritability, recklessness (in terms of decision-making), and delusions or hallucinations. Hypomania is a version of mania where the individual doesn't experience the hallucinations and everyday life is not heavily affected, but they still experience the high energy and excitement. The Depressive state is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness, a loss of interest in living, feeling no pleasure at all in life, loss of energy, and decreased ability to concentrate, among other things.</p>\n<p>There are a number of different subcategories of Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar 1 Disorder, Bipolar 2 Disorder, Cyclothymic Disorder, Cushing's Disease, etc.) in which individuals exhibit these 3 different states in varying degrees and for varying lengths of time, but for the most part, Bipolar Disorder is centered around these 3 states. As you can see, the disorder is far more complex than \"changing one's mind\" or \"mood swings\". Someone can experience a manic episode and not actually be particularly 'happy' about anything, just as someone can experience a depressive episode and not be particularly 'sad' about anything. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/newsletters/bipolar.jpg\" alt=\"Bipolar, created and owned by Toby Allen\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Bipolar, created and owned by Toby Allen\n</div>\n<br /> \n<h3>Bipolar Disorder Abstracted</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The bipolar monster is in fact two opposing consciousnesses fighting for control over one body. One consciousness expresses a constant state of mania, feeling very excitable and overactive, while the other is forever in a low and depressive state. usually, only one personality has control at any given time, while the dormant side fights to take over the body.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>They use gaseous pheromones to dominate and attempt to take over their shared body, influencing anyone that is in close proximity to the monster and passing the dominant state over to the victim. The victim will then experience alternating states like the monster itself. This monster is extremely quick and agile, making it very difficult to identify.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a great depiction of the disorder, and the idea of two opposing consciousnesses really captures the essence of have two polar opposites (\"bipolar\", two poles) in one physical space. I would question the part about \"one personality\" having control though, because bipolar disorder is more so about a single person in different states, rather than a single person displaying different personalities. The latter is actually Dissociative Identity Disorder (also known as Multiple Personality Disorder).</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/39d07f89-892f-4bd5-b120-0f8b55e6630c.jpg\" alt=\"Relevance in Global Community\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Relevance in Our Community</h3>\n<p>There have been a number of celebrities who have made known that they struggle with Bipolar disorder (included in <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/ss/slideshow-celebrities-bipolar-disorder\">this list from WebMD</a> are Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, Jimi Hendrix, and Winston Churchill). It isn't an easy condition to talk about, but making the world aware of their experiences has brought about a more profound public interest in mental health and what we can do about improving its current situation in the world. Things like this are great advancements for mental health, but then we have expression on the opposite end of the spectrum that completely ruin everything we are working so hard to change. </p>\n<p>In this instance, I'm referring specifically to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrJXOmqviiw\">Gucci Mane's song \"BiPolar\"</a> featuring Quavo. If you haven't heard it yet, check it out at the link so you'll know what I'm talking about here (the link goes to a YouTube account's version other than Gucci Mane's original because I wanted the clean version). I do love the track itself without words— in fact, it's one of the more catchy beats I've gotten stuck in my head— but the overall messaging is very destructive.</p>\n<p>I'll highlight a few of the problematic parts of the song (almost all of it is problematic, really) and briefly explain why they are so problematic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>\"Bipolar with the check (bipolar) I just put somethin' crazy 'round my neck (bipolar)\"</em></strong> — This line hits on the all-too-common misconception that people struggling with mental illnesses are \"crazy\". The word \"crazy\" is misused so often in our society that it doesn't even mean anything anymore. It seems to mostly be used to characterize something we don't understand. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Go crazy with your ex (bipolar)</em></strong> — Again, equating Bipolar Disorder (and really equating mental illnesses in general) with being or going \"crazy\". No bueno.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>I just might go crazy with my [expletive] (bipolar)</em></strong> — Yes, Gucci Mane does really drill it into our heads that he thinks that being Bipolar makes people \"crazy\". This idea of \"going crazy\" combined with mental illness is a huge step backwards in positive awareness, especially for people who don't actually know much about it to begin with and just listen to this song several times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar, man I keep on switchin' whips (bipolar)</em></strong> — I noted this earlier in this edition, but many people thing that Bipolar Disorder is just \"switching\" things. Switching one's mind about something, changing emotional state, etc. Clearly wrong, but here it is nonetheless in a song that has been listened to undoubtedly millions of times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>I just went bipolar, put my wrist on Tom Cruise (ooh)</em></strong> — I'm not sure what is implied by \"going Bipolar\", but if it is anything like \"going crazy\" (the rest of this song would indicate is the case here), it is not a positive, and is honestly very ignorant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Insane man, my stash man, it's crazy in the Range, He must be bipolar cause he can't stay in his lane</em></strong> — Equating mental illness with insanity is never okay, yet ignorance wins out here in the world of Hip Hop because it <em>sounds good</em>. We also see more plays here on the misconception that being Bipolar is just about \"changing\" things, like changing lanes while in a car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar, C-Murder, the Draco with the shank</em></strong> — Sure, C-Murder seems like a clever reference to throw into a song, but there are already enough people in the world who think mental illnesses make people violent, and putting a line in the song that obviously sounds like \"Bipolar, see murder\", without a doubt destroys the progress being made in teaching people that mental illness doesn't make people dangerous and violent. This is especially harmful for the impressionable youth who really don't know any better and who may be \"learning\" about Bipolar Disorder for the first time while listening to this song.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Swappin' out the Lamb', think I'm crazy</em></strong> — This one has been covered in a similar point above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Bipolar gang 'cause I spazz on that [expletive]</em></strong> — I don't think I have to even explain this one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Went bipolar in Chanel, went bipolar on the scale, Went bipolar on the plug, told him, \"Feed me bales\", Went bipolar on drugs, they be telling me, \"Chill\"</em></strong> — More instances of \"going Bipolar\", Gucci Mane clearly doesn't get it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though speaking about these issues in different mediums is usually great, there are clearly examples, such as this one, where people will surely get the wrong ideas about what mental illness really is because of simple ignorance. Sure, Gucci Mane may have intended to do a good thing with this track in bringing awareness to his own struggle with Bipolar Disorder (probably not, judging from the lyrics), but there should have been someone in the studio with enough awareness of mental illness to advise him that these lyrics are destructive and that he should come at it from a different angle. Maybe that did happen and he didn't listen. Who really knows?</p>\n<p>As far as our action is concerned, we can use the knowledge gained in this playbook and from other sources to make a positive difference in the conversation around mental health, and the world seems to need it now more than ever.</p>\n <br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/6811f08f-be0d-4024-a560-2682542e9943.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in light bulb vases\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jagoda Kondratiuk on Unsplash  \n</div>\n<br />\n<h3>This Week's Mental Health Hack</h3>\n<p>Celebrate the small wins. It's really easy to only measure the big, obvious wins in life and to just strive for those. It's great to have really big goals, but in reality, the bigger the win, the harder it is to achieve and, more often than not, a big win is made up of several small wins along the way.</p>\n<p>For me, I celebrate when I extend my hand first for a handshake, knowing how much I struggle with this. I celebrate going to sleep on time, finishing all my tasks for a day, and even making eye contact with strangers at work and smiling or saying 'hi'. Also note that \"celebrating\" doesn't necessarily mean \"eat a whole gallon of Party Time ice cream from Publix\" (that's what it used to mean for me). Your celebration can be as big or small as you want.</p>\n<p>All of these small things build into a bigger overall picture of myself that I'm striving for, but if I didn't celebrate these small wins, I may feel like I'm not even making progress. Celebrate your small wins this week and remember that <em>\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\"</em> - that Lao Tzu guy.</p>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/f1cb78de-9b26-4bbf-80de-b64f00028e4c.jpg\" alt=\"Child looking at stairs\"></p>\n<div class=\"photo-credit\"> \n    Photo by Jukan Tateisi on Unsplash\n</div>\n<br />  \n<h3>Weekly Challenge</h3>\n<p>This week, the challenge will be to use the mental health hack described above.
