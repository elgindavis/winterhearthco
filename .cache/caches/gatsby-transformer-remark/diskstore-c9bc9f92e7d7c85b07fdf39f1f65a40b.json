The first difference is that shyness is a personality trait, while social anxiety is a condition that exists on a chemical level. Individuals like myself who struggle with social anxiety disorder aren't necessarily shy, though people who don't fully understand how it works often label me and others as being shy. Social anxiety is usually driven by an increase of adrenaline, which leads to an increased heart rate, and cortisol, which is the primary stress hormone. People who have SA experience these increases primarily in social situations as the brain determines that these situations call for a serious biological response. The second major difference between SA and shyness is that SA is also rooted in fear of some unwanted event happening, though the fear is often irrational and unwarranted.","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":2268},"end":{"line":24,"column":989,"offset":3256},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":2268},"end":{"line":24,"column":989,"offset":3256},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","value":"<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/3d07bdd6-8a10-4fcf-b3a5-4a8e1a1eddb8.gif' alt='Spongebob hyperventilating'/>\n</div>","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1,"offset":3258},"end":{"line":28,"column":7,"offset":3467},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"A common theme that you'll see with many mental health concerns is that rationality cannot always simply overpower the biochemical wirings of the brain.

Boy, was I excited for those gummy snacks. We started snack time and I got out my gummy snacks, ready to go to town. I started trying to open it, but it proved to be more than a little difficult for my baby-carrot fingers at the time. I pulled and pulled, until finally the bag burst open and the gummies flew in all directions all over the floor. So what did I do next? Yep, you guessed it. I started crying. Just kidding, I really wanted those gummies. Instead of standing there crying, I bent down to the floor and popped the gummies into my mouth, one-by-one, carpet hair and all. I wasn't at all prepared for what happened next. Everybody in the entire class had stopped what they were doing and all 40+ eyeballs were fixed on me, watching me eat food off the floor. The blank stares were then followed by waves of \"Ew, that's gross!\" and \"You're nasty!\", and even the teacher added in a \"That's gross, what are you doing???\" As you could imagine, I was thoroughly humiliated, and for a 3-year-old boy, such a moment does quite a number on the brain and psyche.","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":1,"offset":5028},"end":{"line":71,"column":1614,"offset":6641},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":1,"offset":5028},"end":{"line":71,"column":1614,"offset":6641},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","value":"<div class='text-center pb-20 pt-20'>\n    <img height=300 src='https://gallery.mailchimp.com/82935dc1a750f772912d12316/images/7f77e480-fcd1-4565-9471-5fbac1a36c27.gif' alt='Crying gumball machine boy'/>\n</div>","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":1,"offset":6644},"end":{"line":75,"column":7,"offset":6853},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ever since then, I have this looming fear of failing (and thusly being ridiculed or humiliated) in social situations such as that one.

For myself in particular, when I'm talking about something I'm struggling with related to my anxiety, the most unhelpful things people say to me include \"it's all in your head\" or \"you're just overthinking things\", or worse, \"stop being so negative/anxious all the time\". I'd say that these things are generally unhelpful for anyone with a mental disorder, and they show a lack of true empathy or really any kind of intent to understand. People struggling with social anxiety disorder don't need you to tell them what to do or how to think and certainly not how to feel, and if we're being completely honest, most of the people giving out these instructions and bits of advice don't really know what they are talking about anyway, though their intentions may be pure.","position":{"start":{"line":109,"column":1,"offset":9719},"end":{"line":109,"column":1049,"offset":10767},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":109,"column":1,"offset":9719},"end":{"line":109,"column":1049,"offset":10767},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"What they need from you instead is simple.
