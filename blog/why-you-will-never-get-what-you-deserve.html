										Why You’ll Never Get What You Deserve
									</h3>
									<!-- @Intro -->
									<p class="excerpt">
										Tommy is a hard worker, and he’s been that way his whole life. He grew up watching his dad go in to work early every day at the automobile factory. Often he would listen to his dad’s stories about the beauty of hard work and how hard work always pays off in the long-run. Tommy applied this work ethic throughout high school to his studies. He achieved an excellent GPA and got accepted into his dream school to study economics and business.
									</p>
									<p> 
										After graduating, Tommy comes in to work early every morning to make sure everything is ready for an effective day of work. He has been working hard as a financial planner at the company for years, and has contributed lots of value to the culture and to the bottom-line. He has great attention to detail, and he’s also a very competent leader of his team. There’s a big promotion coming up for the head financial advisor position, and Tommy is ready to move up the ladder. If anyone in the company is deserving of this promotion, it’s Tommy. Here’s the catch— he actually doesn’t deserve this promotion, and he never will. Let me explain.

									<h3 class="article-header">The problem with "deserving"</h3>
									<p>
										What comes to mind when you think of someone who deserves something? Is it a high school student with good grades and high SAT scores that deserves to get into a top university? Or maybe you think of someone who committed a crime and the kind of punishment they deserve. Perhaps a star athlete comes to mind— someone who has major talent and deserves to win a championship or medal. Maybe you even think of a hard-working person like Tommy deserving a promotion at the office. Those examples have a common issue: They share the perception that actions serve as a trigger to the universe that some outcome <em>should</em> happen. In a word, these examples are based on entitlement.
									</p>
									<!-- <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:78%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/srb6bXZHbgDsc" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div> -->
									<p>
										Some people spend their whole lives believing that the world <em>should</em> work in a certain way or that it owes them something. This sets them up for variably unrealistic expectations of worldly outcomes. “I deserved that promotion.” “They deserved that award.” “He deserves to be in prison.” “She deserved to get fired.” ‘I deserved to get into that school.” This sense of entitlement is so common in the world, but it’s a distorted and confounding perspective. You are never entitled to a certain outcome. Nor am I. In fact, nobody is ever entitled to a certain outcome, and that is perhaps the most beautiful part of this truth.
									</p>
									<!-- <h3 class="article-header">Curiosity.</h3> -->
									<p>
										Coming into high school, I was denied admittance to a school of the arts after my audition as a trumpet player. I was also denied a spot in the All-District Honors County Jazz Band later that year. <em>Should</em> I have been outraged that I thought they didn’t recognize that I deserved a spot in their school or in that band? <em>Should</em> I have complained that they clearly didn’t recognize talent when they saw it? <em>Should</em> I reconsider my self-worth after failing to be admitted to these groups? Of course not. Yet, this is what so many of us do when reality doesn’t meet our expectations. This is often because we base our expectations on what we believe we deserved or which outcomes we believe we were entitled to. While it may sound ridiculous to ask those questions out loud, many of us still find ourselves asking them anyway.
									</p>
									<p>
										Here’s a question: Does the fact that you exist mean that the world owes you something in particular? As wonderful as I think you are, this world has no darlings, and it owes no debts to any man. We come into this world with nothing, and we will leave it just the same. Rest assured, the idea presented here is not that life is hopeless or that we’re not good enough to get what we want. You and your work are absolutely valuable, and hard work and diligence do often pay off. With that said, we must still understand how to frame our perspective, manage expectations, and learn how to manage our emotions. </p> 
									<p>
										We see amazing football players go un-drafted in the NFL all the time. Why is that? Because they didn’t deserve to get drafted? Is it the case that only the people who deserved to get drafted were actually drafted? If someone isn’t selected during the draft, they simply weren’t selected during the draft. There’s no purpose in pondering who is more deserving than another to be drafted, because it will never change a single outcome. Most players are grateful to have even been afforded the opportunity to be a part of the draft, which is a much healthier and balanced mindset to adopt.

									</p>	
									<!-- <div class="text-center" style="width:50%;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;position:relative;">
										<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT39DdCseASAd2yaPe" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
									</div>		 -->	
									<h3 class="article-header">A pride-free mindset</h3>
									<p>
										When we adopt a humble mindset, things that go poorly don’t fall short of our expectations. This is because there was no initial belief of a guarantee for a certain outcome. Positive things that happen become cherished bonuses to be grateful for and appreciated. This mindset doesn’t mean that you put in any less effort in your endeavors or have any lest zeal for life. Instead you are learning to manage your frame of mind for outcomes beyond your control. You’ll still work hard in school to have a strong college application, but a denial won’t change your view of your self-worth. You’ll still practice countless hours to perfect your audition materials, but a poor outcome won't impact your confidence. You’ll still work really hard for that promotion, but being passed up only makes you work harder and smarter.
									</p>
									<p>
										At this point we raise the idea of merit, which I favor over the idea of entitlement by far. Merit implies a certain worthiness or fitness for an outcome to happen based on demonstrated achievement, ability, or the like. Tommy would certainly merit that promotion based on his work ethic and history, but that still doesn’t entitle him to have the position. That is to say that he also doesn’t “deserve” it (nor does anyone else). The difference between merit and entitlement is that merit is at least more objective in deeming why a certain result <em>should</em> occur. Even then, there is no universal law that says that the things that <em>should</em> happen will happen. This is why expecting <em>should</em>’s to always translate to <em>will</em>’s isn’t a reliable perspective framework. Tommy's hard work and attention to detail may increase the likelihood that the employers choose him for the position, but we can’t sensibly assign further meaning as to whether or not he (or anyone else) “deserves” the position more than the rest.
									</p>

									<h3 class="article-header">But what about the things we all actually deserve?</h3>	
									<p>
										I expect many burning questions in response to this idea, such as: “What about deserving to be treated fairly?” “Are we not all entitled to be treated equally?” “What about deserving a right to live and be happy and safe?” “What about deserving to be loved?”<br><br>
 
										These are all great things that we all understand, value, and appreciate, but what does it really mean to deserve them? These are tenets that must be present to form strong human relationships and a well-functioning, fair society for sure. However, to “deserve” these things means that we did something to earn them, and thus we <em>should</em> be entitled to have them. “Deserving” is really the wrong word here, and it’s also the wrong way to think about these matters. Let’s analyze one of these questions: <br>
										 
										<blockquote>“Why do I deserve to be treated fairly?” > Because all people <em>should</em> be treated fairly.
										 <br>
										“Why <em>should</em> all people be treated fairly?” > Because societies built on fairness are more trusting and amiable. </blockquote>
										 
										In this example, the situation is actually not about being deserving at all— it’s about the goal of building a trusting and amiable society. Even so, our belief that something (even something good) <em>should</em> happen still does not mean that it will. If we base our frame of reality on what we believe <em>should</em> happen, life will fail to meet our expectations more often than not. If we want something to change, we change it based on the underlying root goals and facts of the matter— not based on something flimsy like human entitlement.
									</p>
									<p>
										As another example, I could say that I deserve to not have to deal with racial discrimination. It would be really great if nobody had to encounter this, but that belief by itself does not change any outcomes. Societies function much better when people don’t discriminate against each other, but that fact has little to do with my personal ‘deserving’ of anything. If you believe something needs to change, do something to change it. It is certainly helpful to have hope for these really nice things, and it's even better to have the passion and boldness to do something about it. Even so, I consider it to be pointless to expect the idea of entitlement to change even a single outcome— even if it is a great candidate for the <em>should</em> universe.
									</p>
									<h3 class="article-header">Bottom Line</h3>	
									<p>
										The bottom line is this: the concept of “deserving” is rooted in human pride and ego, rather than in gratitude and humility. This may very well be the most destructive part of this mindset. The concept of deserving is both subjective and biased, and more importantly— it isn’t measurable. There’s no way to truly measure how deserving someone is of some outcome, so what is the function that it serves in a healthy mindset? The beauty here lies in the understanding that once we check our egos and stop wasting energy on speculating the things we “rightfully deserve”, we can  focus our energy instead on making our desired outcomes <em>more likely to happen</em> and on being grateful for everything positive that we actually receive. We don’t live in a world of things that <em>“should”</em> or are <em>“supposed to”</em> happen. We live in a world of things that <strong><em>do</em></strong> happen.
									</p>
									<p>
										You’ll never “get what you deserve” in life because you really don’t deserve anything. None of us do. We’re not entitled to any outcome, yet we still have this wonderful, amazing opportunity to find meaning and to enjoy the wonders and marvels of life. We can only learn to truly appreciate and be grateful for these things once we learn to leave our pride and ego at the door.
